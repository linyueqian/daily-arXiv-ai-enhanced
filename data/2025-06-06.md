### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Ke Li, Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati, Benyu Zhang, Jason Liu, Serena Li, Lizhu Zhang, Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes GEM, a self-supervised method enabling decoder-only LLMs to generate high-quality text embeddings without compromising their original capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the inefficiency of using separate embedding models in applications like RAG, which complicates systems and creates discrepancies.

Method: Inserts special tokens and manipulates attention masks to generate summarization embeddings, applicable during post-training or fine-tuning.

Result: Significantly improves text embedding performance (MTEB) with minimal impact on NLP tasks (MMLU), tested on LLMs from 1B to 8B parameters.

Conclusion: GEM successfully enhances LLMs with state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while preserving their original NLP performance.

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong, Vineel Pratap, Michael Auli, Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Increasing speaker count in ASR training data improves robustness to unseen accents more than increasing audio duration per speaker or accent diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR systems' robustness to diverse and unseen accents, especially in low-resource settings.

Method: Studied the impact of speaker count, audio duration per speaker, and accent diversity in training data on ASR performance for unseen accents.

Result: More speakers (with less audio per speaker) improves ASR robustness; accent diversity has minimal impact when speaker count is fixed.

Conclusion: Prioritize increasing speaker count over other variables for better ASR performance in new languages.

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan, Vikram Natarajan, Jonathan Michala, Milton Lin, Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components using dictionary learning on token-level representations, revealing linear encodings of semantic and syntactic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentence embeddings are opaque; their internal structure and features are not human-interpretable, hindering transparency and control.

Method: Proposes dictionary learning on token-level representations to decompose embeddings, analyzing pooling and latent features.

Result: Reveals linear encodings of semantic and syntactic aspects in embeddings, enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: Bridges token and sentence-level interpretability, making embeddings more transparent and controllable.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal, Saurabh Kumar, Priyanka Bhatt, Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HTC-CLIP combines label hierarchy and text encoding using contrastive learning, improving performance over existing methods by 0.99-2.37% in Macro F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HTC models handle label hierarchy and text encoding separately or guide hierarchy in the encoder, but these approaches are complementary.

Method: HTC-CLIP learns hierarchy-aware text and path-guided hierarchy representations via contrastive learning, pooling both during inference.

Result: HTC-CLIP outperforms state-of-the-art models by 0.99-2.37% in Macro F1 on two benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Combining complementary approaches in HTC-CLIP enhances performance, proving the effectiveness of integrating hierarchy and text representations.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef, Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform poorly on low-resource languages like Maltese, with fine-tuned smaller models outperforming larger ones. Pre-training and instruction-tuning in Maltese are key to better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLM performance on low-resource languages and identify factors affecting their effectiveness, focusing on Maltese.

Method: Assessed 55 LLMs on 11 tasks for Maltese, analyzing performance factors like pre-training and fine-tuning.

Result: Smaller fine-tuned models often outperform larger ones; prior exposure to Maltese is crucial. Fine-tuning beats prompting in performance and cost.

Conclusion: Advocates for inclusive language tech and suggests traditional approaches for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar, Sourav Bansal, Neeraj Agrawal, Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a model for few-shot intent classification in customer care, improving accuracy by 20-23% over SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of limited annotated domain-specific data in customer care, aiming to generalize models across domains (geography, channel, language).

Method: Uses an embedder-cum-classifier with supervised fine-tuning, isotropic regularizers, and multilingual knowledge distillation.

Result: Achieves 20-23% higher accuracy in few-shot intent detection on e-commerce datasets (Canada, Mexico).

Conclusion: The model effectively generalizes across domains with minimal annotations, offering practical value for customer care automation.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti, Tatsuya Aoyama, Ethan Wilcox, Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human-scale language models generalize form but not meaning of rare constructions like LET-ALONE, unlike humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if language models generalize both form and meaning of rare constructions, as humans do.

Method: Tested human-scale transformer models on the rare LET-ALONE construction using a synthetic benchmark for form and meaning.

Result: Models generalized form but failed to generalize meaning, showing an asymmetry in sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Current architectures lack human-like efficiency in learning meaning from rare constructions.

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect perceived emotions in text for SemEval-2025 Task 11, Subtask A, focusing on speaker emotions like joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust.

Method: Uses an ensemble of models to predict emotions without requiring additional training.

Result: Achieves results comparable to top systems, with better efficiency, scalability, and ease of implementation.

### [10] [Zero-Shot Open-Schema Entity Structure Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04458)
*Xueqiang Xu, Jinfeng Xiao, James Barry, Mohab Elkaref, Jiaru Zou, Pengcheng Jiang, Yunyi Zhang, Max Giammona, Geeth de Mel, Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZOES is a zero-shot, open-schema method for entity structure extraction without predefined schemas or annotations, outperforming existing LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods rely on predefined schemas or annotated data, leading to incomplete results. ZOES aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: ZOES uses enrichment, refinement, and unification to mutually reinforce entity and structure extraction, requiring no schema or annotations.

Result: ZOES improves LLMs' extraction completeness across three domains, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: The enrichment-refinement-unification mechanism in ZOES offers a principled way to enhance LLM-based entity structure discovery.

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [11] [LESS: Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-Supervised Learning for Speech Foundational Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04586)
*Wen Ding, Fan Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LESS is a framework using LLMs to refine pseudo labels from ASR/AST data, improving performance in speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance semi-supervised learning by leveraging LLMs for correcting pseudo labels in speech processing tasks.

Method: Refines pseudo-labeled text from ASR/AST using LLMs and employs data filtering for efficient knowledge transfer.

Result: Achieves 3.77% WER reduction in Mandarin ASR and high BLEU scores in Spanish-to-English AST tasks.

Conclusion: LESS is adaptable across languages and tasks, with insights on LLM use in speech processing.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

### [12] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma, NhatHai Phan, Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how watermarking techniques (Gumbel and KGW) affect LLM alignment (truthfulness, safety, helpfulness), identifies degradation patterns, and proposes Alignment Resampling (AR) to mitigate these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underexamined effects of watermarking on LLM alignment properties and address the resulting degradation patterns.

Method: Systematic analysis of watermarking effects, introduction of AR (inference-time sampling with an external reward model), and modified Gumbel watermarking for diversity.

Result: AR recovers or surpasses baseline alignment scores with 2-4 samples, maintaining detectability. Modified Gumbel ensures compatibility with AR.

Conclusion: Balancing watermark strength and alignment is critical; AR provides a practical solution for deploying watermarked LLMs responsibly.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

### [13] [MMSU: A Massive Multi-task Spoken Language Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04779)
*Dingdong Wang, Jincenzi Wu, Junan Li, Dongchao Yang, Xueyuan Chen, Tianhua Zhang, Helen Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMSU, a benchmark for evaluating SpeechLLMs' ability to understand and reason with spoken language, covering diverse linguistic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SpeechLLMs lack fine-grained perception and reasoning in natural speech, necessitating a comprehensive benchmark.

Method: MMSU includes 5,000 audio-question-answer triplets across 47 tasks, incorporating phonetics, prosody, semantics, and paralinguistics.

Result: Evaluation of 14 SpeechLLMs reveals significant gaps, suggesting areas for future improvement.

Conclusion: MMSU sets a new standard for assessing spoken language understanding, aiding the development of advanced human-AI speech systems.

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation for improving Bhojpuri-Hindi speech translation using SeamlessM4T, showing significant performance gains in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance translation quality for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair by optimizing hyperparameters and applying data augmentation techniques.

Method: Systematic hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, update steps, etc.) and data augmentation (speed perturbation, SpecAugment). Cross-lingual training with Marathi and Bhojpuri data was also tested.

Result: Careful hyperparameter selection and simple augmentation techniques significantly improved translation performance. Error analysis highlighted issues affecting BLEU scores.

Conclusion: Hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation are effective for low-resource speech translation, with potential for further improvements through error analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

*Zhaoxuan Tan, Zheng Li, Tianyi Liu, Haodong Wang, Hyokun Yun, Ming Zeng, Pei Chen, Zhihan Zhang, Yifan Gao, Ruijie Wang, Priyanka Nigam, Bing Yin, Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PUGC leverages implicit preferences in unlabeled user-generated content (UGC) to improve LLM alignment, reducing reliance on costly curated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference learning methods depend on expensive curated data, limiting scalability. PUGC aims to use implicit preferences in UGC for cost-effective alignment.

Method: PUGC transforms UGC into queries and reference texts, scoring responses to align models with implicit preferences.

Result: Models trained with PUGC show a 9.37% performance boost and a 35.93% state-of-the-art win rate on Alpaca Eval 2.

Conclusion: PUGC offers a scalable, domain-specific solution for LLM alignment, improving reward quality and robustness.

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an incremental semi-supervised learning pipeline for fine-tuning ASR models in low-resource domains, leveraging auxiliary data and pseudo-label refinement to outperform single-step fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging due to scarce labeled data, though unlabeled audio and related-domain labeled data are often available.

Method: An incremental pipeline integrates small in-domain labeled data and auxiliary data, then refines pseudo-labels using multi-model consensus or NER filtering.

Result: The method achieves 4% improvement over no auxiliary data initially, with consensus-based filtering providing up to 22.3% and 24.8% relative improvements on Wow and Fisher corpora, respectively.

Conclusion: Consensus-based filtering is most effective, while NER offers competitive performance at lower cost, demonstrating the pipeline's superiority over single-step fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

### [17] [A Practitioner's Guide to Building ASR Models for Low-Resource Languages: A Case Study on Scottish Gaelic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04915)
*Ondřej Klejch, William Lamb, Peter Bell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the belief that fine-tuning multilingual E2E models is the best approach for low-resource ASR, proposing a hybrid HMM and self-supervised method that outperforms fine-tuning by 32% WER reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fine-tuning multilingual E2E models for low-resource languages, especially when the language wasn't in the original training data.

Method: Combines hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models, leveraging continued pre-training and semi-supervised training to utilize all available data.

Result: Achieves a 32% relative WER reduction over fine-tuned Whisper models on Scottish Gaelic.

Conclusion: The hybrid HMM and self-supervised approach is more effective than fine-tuning for low-resource ASR, offering significant performance improvements.

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

*Yue Gong, Chuan Lei, Xiao Qin, Kapil Vaidya, Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy, Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens is a framework for detecting and correcting semantic errors in LLM-generated SQL, improving accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce semantically incorrect SQL queries, lacking reliability insights, prompting the need for a robust error detection and correction system.

Method: SQLens integrates error signals from the database and LLM to identify and correct semantic errors in SQL clauses.

Result: SQLens outperforms LLM-based self-evaluation by 25.78% in F1 for error detection and boosts execution accuracy by up to 20%.

Conclusion: SQLens effectively enhances the reliability and accuracy of text-to-SQL systems by addressing semantic errors in LLM-generated queries.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating wav2vec 2.0 with Phi-4 MLLM to overcome modality-specific limitations in spoken language assessment, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERT and wav2vec 2.0 have modality-specific limitations in spoken language assessment (SLA), prompting the need for a combined approach.

Method: A system integrating wav2vec 2.0 and Phi-4 MLLM via score fusion is proposed.

Result: The system achieves an RMSE of 0.375, securing second place in the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025.

Conclusion: The integration of multimodal models improves SLA performance by leveraging complementary strengths.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of how large audio-language models (LALMs) process auditory attributes, revealing layer-dependent information flow and a method to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LALMs' internal mechanisms for interpreting behavior and improving performance.

Method: Applied vocabulary projection on three LALMs to track attribute information evolution across layers and token positions.

Result: Attribute information decreases with layer depth during recognition failure; early resolution improves accuracy. LALMs rely on querying inputs rather than hidden state aggregation.

Conclusion: Findings provide insights for enhancing LALMs and improving auditory attribute processing.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLIDE integrates Small (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve reliability in ambiguous scenarios, while DRE refines their collaboration for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of LLMs (unreliable in ambiguity) and SLMs (vulnerable to adversarial inputs) by combining their strengths.

Method: Introduce SLIDE for adaptive weighting of SLMs and LLMs, and DRE for refining evaluations via SLM insights and adjustments.

Result: DRE outperforms existing methods, aligning better with human judgment in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining SLMs and LLMs enhances reliability, especially for open-ended tasks like dialogue evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAVL, a multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable lyrics translation, and proposes SylAVL-CoT, a model that outperforms text-based methods by integrating audio-video cues and syllabic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lyrics translation must balance semantic accuracy with musical rhythm and style, especially in animated musicals where alignment with visual and auditory cues is critical.

Method: The authors develop MAVL, a benchmark combining text, audio, and video, and propose SylAVL-CoT, a syllable-constrained model using audio-video cues and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: SylAVL-CoT outperforms text-based models in singability and contextual accuracy, highlighting the benefits of multimodal approaches.

Conclusion: Multimodal, multilingual methods like SylAVL-CoT are superior for lyrics translation, offering richer and more expressive results than text-only approaches.

Abstract: Lyrics translation requires both accurate semantic transfer and preservation
of musical rhythm, syllabic structure, and poetic style. In animated musicals,
the challenge intensifies due to alignment with visual and auditory cues. We
introduce Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Benchmark for Animated Song
Translation (MAVL), the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable
lyrics translation. By integrating text, audio, and video, MAVL enables richer
and more expressive translations than text-only approaches. Building on this,
we propose Syllable-Constrained Audio-Video LLM with Chain-of-Thought
SylAVL-CoT, which leverages audio-video cues and enforces syllabic constraints
to produce natural-sounding lyrics. Experimental results demonstrate that
SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and
contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual
approaches for lyrics translation.

*Di Wu, Seth Aycock, Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper questions the effectiveness of explicit decomposition in LLM-based translation, finding no clear evidence for its benefits and showing that simple "translate again" prompts outperform step-by-step methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scrutinize the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLM-based translation, given its recent success in tasks like WMT24.

Method: Empirical analysis comparing step-by-step prompting (e.g., decomposition and refinement) with simpler prompts like "translate again."

Result: No clear evidence that step-by-step decomposition improves translation; simpler prompts yield better results.

Conclusion: The role of reasoning in translation remains unclear, inviting further research into CoT's effectiveness factors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

*William Sheffield, Kanishka Misra, Valentina Pyatkin, Ashwini Deo, Kyle Mahowald, Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines LLMs' ability to distinguish fine-grained senses of the discourse particle 'just,' finding they struggle with subtle nuances despite some success in broader categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discourse particles like 'just' have nuanced semantic effects, and understanding LLMs' limitations in capturing these nuances is crucial for improving their linguistic capabilities.

Method: The study uses expert-labeled data to evaluate LLMs' performance in differentiating the diverse senses of 'just.'

Result: LLMs show partial success in distinguishing broader categories but fail to fully grasp subtle nuances of 'just.'

Conclusion: The findings highlight a gap in LLMs' understanding of discourse particles, suggesting room for improvement in their semantic analysis.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' performance on questions without reasonable answers, highlighting their flaws.

Method: Developed a benchmark for unanswerable questions and modified existing datasets for testing.

Result: Existing models perform poorly on such questions, far from perfect.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for better LLM evaluation methods, with tools available for further research.

Abstract: We propose that benchmarking LLMs on questions which have no reasonable
answer actually isn't as silly as it sounds. We also present a benchmark that
allows such testing and a method to modify the existing datasets, and discover
that existing models demonstrate a performance far from the perfect on such
questions. Our code and data artifacts are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSA-MTE, a large-scale dataset for evaluating machine translation (MT) quality in under-resourced African languages, and proposes improved metrics (SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE) that outperform existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MT evaluation metrics lack coverage and perform poorly for African languages, especially in low-resource settings.

Method: The authors create a human-annotated dataset (SSA-MTE) and develop new metrics (SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE), also benchmarking LLM-based approaches.

Result: SSA-COMET outperforms AfriCOMET and competes with top LLMs like Gemini 2.5 Pro, particularly for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The work provides open resources to advance MT evaluation for African languages, addressing gaps in current methods.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released

TL;DR: The paper introduces Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), a novel method for speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning, improving conversational abilities and reducing inference latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance speech language models (SLMs) by leveraging dual-channel speech data for more natural and fluid spoken interactions.

Method: Proposes NTPP, a generative modeling paradigm using decoder-only architectures to exploit dual-channel speech data.

Result: NTPP improves turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness while achieving lower inference latency.

Conclusion: NTPP is a practical and efficient solution for real-time spoken dialogue applications.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest
in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken
interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of
several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current
approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently
captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we
systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of
modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling
paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent
dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the
first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical
results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the
conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response
coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP
achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical
efficiency for real-time applications.

*Yangui Fang, Baixu Cheng, Jing Peng, Xu Li, Yu Xi, Chengwei Zhang, Guohui Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLLM-CF, a framework to correct ASR errors using LLMs without training or labeled data, addressing hallucinations by pre-detecting errors and verifying corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ASR error correction methods are limited, and LLMs, while powerful, risk modifying correct text due to hallucinations.

Method: RLLM-CF involves three stages: error pre-detection, iterative correction via chain-of-thought sub-tasks, and reasoning verification.

Result: Experiments show GPT-4o with RLLM-CF reduces CER/WER by 21%, 11%, 9%, and 11.4% on datasets.

Conclusion: RLLM-CF effectively corrects ASR errors without additional data or fine-tuning, ensuring reliability.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) error correction aims to correct
recognition errors while preserving accurate text. Although traditional
approaches demonstrate moderate effectiveness, LLMs offer a paradigm that
eliminates the need for training and labeled data. However, directly using LLMs
will encounter hallucinations problem, which may lead to the modification of
the correct text. To address this problem, we propose the Reliable LLM
Correction Framework (RLLM-CF), which consists of three stages: (1) error
pre-detection, (2) chain-of-thought sub-tasks iterative correction, and (3)
reasoning process verification. The advantage of our method is that it does not
require additional information or fine-tuning of the model, and ensures the
correctness of the LLM correction under multi-pass programming. Experiments on
AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2, and Librispeech show that the GPT-4o model enhanced by
our framework achieves 21%, 11%, 9%, and 11.4% relative reductions in CER/WER.

*Can Zheng, Yuhan Cao, Xiaoning Dong, Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how malicious agents in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can manipulate prompts to bias system behavior, bypassing detection mechanisms like GPT-4o-mini.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate vulnerabilities in MAS where malicious agents exploit prompt manipulation for self-interest without disrupting core functionality.

Method: Examines four types of integrity attacks (Scapegoater, Boaster, Self-Dealer, Free-Rider) using strategically crafted prompts to bias MAS operations.

Result: Demonstrates that such attacks can systematically bias MAS behavior and bypass advanced LLM-based monitors.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for robust MAS security protocols, content validation, and advanced monitoring systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

*Dimitris Vamvourellis, Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) were tested for zero-shot financial sentiment analysis. Reasoning-based methods didn't improve performance; GPT-4o without Chain-of-Thought prompting performed best, aligning with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how LLMs and prompting strategies perform in financial sentiment analysis, comparing reasoning vs. non-reasoning approaches.

Method: Tested three proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under System 1 and System 2 prompting, benchmarked against fine-tuned models (FinBERT-Prosus, FinBERT-Tone).

Result: Reasoning didn't enhance performance; GPT-4o without CoT prompting was most accurate. Overthinking from reasoning led to worse predictions.

Conclusion: For financial sentiment analysis, intuitive (System 1) thinking aligns better with human judgment than deliberative (System 2) reasoning, challenging the assumption that more reasoning improves LLM decisions.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

*Qingchuan Li, Jiatong Li, Zirui Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Yuting Zeng, Qi Liu, Tongxuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCALe, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle lexical diversification in logical reasoning, and proposes MenTaL, a method to improve LLM translators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with lexical diversification in logical reasoning tasks, and existing benchmarks lack diversity to expose this issue.

Method: Proposes SCALe for benchmarking and MenTaL, a method using tables to unify expressions before translation, applied via in-context learning and SFT.

Result: Experiments show LLMs' deficiencies in handling lexical diversification, while MenTaL significantly improves their performance.

Conclusion: SCALe and MenTaL address LLMs' limitations in lexical diversification, enhancing their reliability in real-world logical reasoning.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

*Jianfei Zhang, Bei Li, Jun Bai, Rumei Li, Yanmeng Wang, Chenghua Lin, Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A gradient matching method for selecting demonstrations in many-shot ICL outperforms random selection, improving performance on large LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on random selection for many-shot demonstrations in ICL is a critical challenge, and the hypothesis is that data requirements for ICL and fine-tuning are similar.

Method: Introduces a gradient matching approach to select demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set and selected examples.

Result: Consistently outperforms random selection, achieving up to 4% improvement on large LLMs like Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B.

Conclusion: The method enables more reliable and effective many-shot ICL, broadening its applicability.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

*Hongjun Liu, Yilun Zhao, Arman Cohan, Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free method, SUCEA, improves fact-checking by rephrasing adversarial claims into simpler sub-claims for better evidence retrieval and entailment prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the difficulty of fact-checking adversarial claims designed to challenge retrieval-augmented systems.

Method: SUCEA modular framework: 1) Claim segmentation, 2) Iterative evidence retrieval and editing, 3) Evidence aggregation and label prediction.

Result: Outperforms four baselines on retrieval and entailment accuracy in two datasets.

Conclusion: SUCEA effectively tackles adversarial claims, enhancing fact-checking performance.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

*Yash Kumar Lal, Manikanta Bandham, Mohammad Saqib Hasan, Apoorva Kashi, Mahnaz Koupaee, Niranjan Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuSciClaims, a benchmark for testing claim verification abilities using multimodal data from scientific figures, highlighting poor performance of vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of multimodal benchmarks for claim verification in scientific literature, despite existing work in related tasks like scientific QA and figure captioning.

Method: Automatically extract supported claims from articles, manually perturb them to create contradicted claims, and introduce diagnostic tasks to analyze model failures.

Result: Vision-language models perform poorly (0.3-0.5 F1), with the best model at 0.77 F1, showing bias towards supported claims and struggles with evidence localization and multimodal aggregation.

Conclusion: Models lack nuanced understanding of claims and figures, emphasizing the need for improved benchmarks and diagnostic tools to enhance claim verification capabilities.

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

*Chengwu Liu, Ye Yuan, Yichun Yin, Yan Xu, Xin Xu, Zaoyu Chen, Yasheng Wang, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu, Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces $Safe$, a formal verification framework using Lean 4 to detect hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought reasoning by providing step-aware proofs, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like PRMs or self-consistency lack verifiable evidence for detecting hallucinations in CoT prompting, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes $Safe$, a retrospective framework that formalizes reasoning steps in Lean 4 and provides proofs to identify hallucinations.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance improvement across models and datasets, with interpretable evidence. Introduces $FormalStep$, a benchmark for step correctness.

Conclusion: First use of Lean 4 for verifying LLM-generated content, aligning with formal languages' purpose to ensure robust proof foundations.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

*Firoz Shaik, Mobashir Sadat, Nikita Gautam, Doina Caragea, Cornelia Caragea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MISMATCHED, a new benchmark for Scientific NLI focusing on non-CS domains, and shows performance gaps in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLI datasets ignore non-CS domains, limiting applicability. MISMATCHED addresses this gap.

Method: The benchmark includes 2,700 annotated pairs from PSYCHOLOGY, ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH. Baselines are established using SLMs and LLMs.

Result: Best baseline achieves 78.17% Macro F1, indicating room for improvement. Training with implicit NLI pairs boosts performance.

Conclusion: MISMATCHED fills a critical gap in NLI evaluation and highlights the need for better models in non-CS domains.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances LLM reasoning by adding compute during inference. ADAPT, a lightweight diversity-aware prefix tuning method, outperforms baselines with 80% accuracy using 8x less compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-optimized LLMs often lack output diversity, limiting TTS effectiveness.

Method: Proposed ADAPT: diversity-aware prefix tuning with a focused data strategy.

Result: ADAPT achieves 80% accuracy on math tasks with 8x less compute than baselines.

Conclusion: Generative diversity is crucial for maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

*Likun Cao, Rui Pan, James Evans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how innovators' subjective perspectives, shaped by their prior experiences, predict future creative achievements. It uses machine learning to model these perspectives and finds that diversity in perspectives (not backgrounds) enhances innovation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how personal perspectives and interpersonal innovation opportunities, derived from prior experiences, influence creative outcomes.

Method: Uses machine learning to model innovators' perspectives based on dynamic language representations. Analyzes data from scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors.

Result: Subjective perspectives predict future creative achievements. Perspective diversity enhances innovation, while background diversity does not.

Conclusion: Successful collaborators use common language to combine diverse experiences, driving innovation. Findings have implications for team assembly and research policy.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: New static word embeddings optimized for sentence semantics outperform existing models and rival basic Sentence Transformers, using PCA and learning methods for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sentence semantic representation with computationally efficient static word embeddings.

Method: Extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence Transformer, enhance with PCA, and refine via knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. Sentence representation is achieved by averaging word embeddings.

Result: Outperforms existing static models on semantic tasks and rivals SimCSE on some datasets. Analyses confirm removal of irrelevant components and norm adjustments based on word influence.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively optimizes static embeddings for sentence semantics, offering a balance between performance and computational cost.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

TL;DR: Tool-MVR enhances LLMs' tool use via high-quality dataset (ToolBench-V) and dynamic reflection learning (EXPLORE), outperforming ToolLLM and GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unreliable tool planning and weak reflection in LLMs due to poor datasets and static learning.

Method: Introduces Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV) for dataset quality and Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE) for dynamic error correction.

Result: Tool-MVR surpasses ToolLLM by 23.9% and GPT-4 by 15.3%, reducing API calls by 31.4%, with strong generalization.

Conclusion: Tool-MVR effectively improves tool utilization and reflection, setting new benchmarks in performance and error correction.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

TL;DR: A practical method for generating AVSR datasets from raw video is introduced, enabling strong baseline models for under-resourced languages like Vietnamese, with competitive performance in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVSR's robustness against noise is hindered by dataset scarcity, especially for non-English languages. Automated data collection can address this gap.

Method: Refines existing techniques to generate AVSR datasets from raw video efficiently. A baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese is developed using this approach.

Result: The automatically collected dataset supports a strong baseline model, performing competitively in clean conditions and outperforming robust ASR in noisy settings.

Conclusion: This efficient method facilitates AVSR expansion to under-resourced languages, overcoming dataset limitations.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaDA is a training-free KV cache compression method using adaptive quantization and mean centering, reducing memory to 27% of baseline while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache memory demands scale poorly with sequence length, hindering scalable deployment of large language models.

Method: TaDA adapts quantization precision to error sensitivity per layer and uses mean centering to avoid outlier handling.

Result: Reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the 16-bit baseline with comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: TaDA enables scalable, high-performance reasoning in language models by supporting longer contexts without separate outlier management.

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

TL;DR: Flex-TravelPlanner is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' dynamic planning skills, revealing gaps in adaptability and constraint prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack dynamic, multi-turn scenarios, limiting evaluation of LLMs' real-world planning capabilities.

Method: Extends TravelPlanner with sequential constraint introduction and prioritized competing constraints, testing GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B.

Result: Models struggle with multi-turn adaptation and constraint prioritization, with performance affected by introduction order.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for dynamic benchmarks and suggests improvements for LLMs in complex planning tasks.

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the inadequacy of current alignment strategies for LLMs, showing they lack deep normative reasoning, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks despite efforts to instill human-like norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing concerns about AI safety and the limitations of existing alignment methods for LLMs, which fail to prevent misuse due to shallow behavioral reinforcement.

Method: Analyzes current alignment strategies, compares them to human deliberative reasoning from moral psychology, and identifies vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Result: LLMs lack robust normative conflict resolution, making them susceptible to adversarial manipulation, even with reasoning-focused advancements.

Conclusion: Current alignment methods are insufficient for AI safety, necessitating deeper normative reasoning capabilities in LLMs to mitigate potential harms.

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REWIRE recycles low-quality web data by enriching it, improving model performance by 1.0-2.5 percentage points across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'data wall' in pre-training by reusing discarded low-quality data.

Method: Proposes REWIRE, a method to enrich low-quality documents for training.

Result: Improves performance by 1.0-2.5 points across 22 tasks; outperforms 2x web data and other synthetic methods.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts is a simple, effective way to scale pre-training data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting implicit hate speech (im-HS) by introducing a taxonomy with six codetypes and two methods using LLMs, showing improved detection across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of hate speech online, especially subtle forms like im-HS, poses societal and individual risks, necessitating better detection methods.

Method: Two approaches: 1) prompting LLMs to classify im-HS, and 2) embedding codetypes during LLM encoding.

Result: Codetypes enhance im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy and methods effectively improve im-HS detection, demonstrating cross-language applicability.

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

TL;DR: STAND is a model-free speculative decoding method that accelerates language model reasoning by leveraging redundancy in reasoning paths, reducing latency by 60-65% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling techniques for language models are computationally expensive, creating a performance-efficiency trade-off.

Method: STAND uses stochastic drafting, logit-based N-gram modules, Gumbel-Top-K sampling, and data-driven tree construction to predict tokens efficiently.

Result: STAND reduces inference latency by 60-65% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 14-28% in throughput while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: STAND is a plug-and-play solution for accelerating any language model without additional training.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

### [49] [SPARTA ALIGNMENT: Collectively Aligning Multiple Language Models through Combat](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04721)
*Yuru Jiang, Wenxuan Ding, Shangbin Feng, Greg Durrett, Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT is an algorithm where multiple LLMs compete and evaluate each other to improve diversity and reduce biases, outperforming baselines in most tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses lack of diversity and biases in single-model generation and evaluation by leveraging competition among multiple LLMs.

Method: LLMs form a 'sparta tribe,' competing in duels while others evaluate responses. Scores are aggregated via an adapted Elo-ranking system, and models learn from preference pairs.

Result: Outperforms initial models and 4 baselines in 10/12 tasks, with 7% average improvement, and generalizes better to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables iterative self-evolution of LLMs, producing more logical and informative outputs through collective competition.

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

*Ziyi Zhou, Xiaoming Zhang, Litian Zhang, Yibo Zhang, Zhenyu Guan, Chaozhuo Li, Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces C²EFND, a framework combining LLMs and SLMs for fake news detection, addressing data scarcity and adaptability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fake news on social media has serious societal impacts, and existing methods (SLMs and LLMs) have limitations like training demands and outdated knowledge.

Method: C²EFND uses multi-round collaborative learning between LLMs and SLMs, with lifelong knowledge editing and replay-based continual learning.

Result: Experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets show C²EFND outperforms existing methods in accuracy and adaptability.

Conclusion: C²EFND effectively addresses fake news detection challenges by leveraging LLMs and SLMs collaboratively.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

### [51] [Identifying Reliable Evaluation Metrics for Scientific Text Revision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04772)
*Léane Jourdan, Florian Boudin, Richard Dufour, Nicolas Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional text revision metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore, proposing a hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge and domain-specific metrics for better alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore fail to capture meaningful improvements in text revision, necessitating better evaluation methods.

Method: Manual annotation study, exploration of reference-free metrics, and analysis of LLM-as-a-judge approaches for assessing revisions.

Result: LLMs excel at instruction-following but lack correctness, while domain-specific metrics offer complementary insights. A hybrid approach is most reliable.

Conclusion: A hybrid method combining LLM-as-a-judge and task-specific metrics provides the best evaluation of revision quality.

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSSBench is a new benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) tasks, addressing gaps in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks focus on STEM disciplines, neglecting HSS needs like interdisciplinary thinking and abstract-visual linking.

Method: HSSBench includes 13,000+ samples in six categories, generated via a pipeline involving domain experts and automated agents.

Result: Benchmarking 20+ MLLMs shows HSSBench poses significant challenges, even for state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: HSSBench aims to inspire research enhancing MLLMs' cross-disciplinary reasoning and knowledge integration.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

*Jingyu Hu, Mengyue Yang, Mengnan Du, Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper probes LLMs' internal political states using multi-dimensional analysis and representation engineering to address misalignment and concept confounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment between LLMs' responses and internal intentions, and reliance on single-axis political concepts leading to confounds.

Method: A four-dimensional political learning framework with interpretable representation engineering techniques, tested on eight LLMs.

Result: Political concept vectors disentangle confounds, generalize well, and enable intervention for different political leanings.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional analysis and representation engineering improve transparency and control over LLMs' political states.

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

*Jisu An, Junseok Lee, Jeoungeun Lee, Yongseok Son*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A survey on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) analyzes integration methods, representation techniques, and training paradigms, proposing a classification framework based on 125 models to guide future development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of diverse modalities into pre-trained LLMs lacks systematic understanding, creating a gap in literature. This survey aims to address this by providing a structured analysis.

Method: The study examines 125 MLLMs (2021-2025), focusing on three dimensions: architectural strategies for modality integration, representation learning techniques, and training paradigms.

Result: The survey identifies emerging patterns and proposes a taxonomy to classify MLLMs, offering insights into current integration techniques.

Conclusion: The findings aim to guide the development of more robust multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained foundations.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FineLogic is a framework for evaluating LLMs' logical reasoning across accuracy, stepwise soundness, and alignment. It also studies supervision formats, finding natural language aids generalization while symbolic styles improve structural reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus only on final-answer accuracy, missing the quality and structure of reasoning. FineLogic aims to provide a more nuanced evaluation.

Method: Proposes FineLogic for fine-grained evaluation and studies four supervision styles (natural language and symbolic) during fine-tuning.

Result: Natural language supervision generalizes better, while symbolic styles enhance structural reasoning. Fine-tuning improves step-by-step generation, not shortcuts.

Conclusion: FineLogic offers a rigorous, interpretable way to assess and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

*Feijun Liu, Huifeng Wang, Kun Wang, Yizhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-BERT approach for machine translation proofreading achieves high accuracy and outperforms recent methods by over 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve machine translation quality by addressing errors requiring human post-editing.

Method: Combines CNN for local n-gram patterns and BERT for context-rich representations, with error detection and correction modules.

Result: Achieves 90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, outperforming recent techniques.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in identifying and correcting translation errors.

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates VLM and LLM performance on handwritten student exams in Indonesian schools, finding handwriting recognition challenges but some utility in LLM-generated feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of VLM and LLMs in real-world educational settings, especially underrepresented contexts, for automated grading and feedback.

Method: Evaluated a VLM and several LLMs on 646 handwritten exam responses (14K+ answers) from grade 4 students in Indonesia, covering Math and English, including grading and feedback tasks.

Result: VLM struggled with handwriting recognition, affecting LLM grading accuracy, but LLM feedback retained some usefulness despite imperfect input.

Conclusion: While VLMs and LLMs show potential for educational assessment, handwriting recognition and feedback personalization remain challenges.

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

*Martin Andrews, Sam Witteveen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An LLM-based system solves cryptic crossword clues by hypothesizing answers, proposing wordplay explanations, and verifying reasoning steps, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptic crossword clues are complex language tasks with daily new test sets, requiring a system that can interpret and verify wordplay to ensure correctness.

Method: The system uses open-licensed LLM components to hypothesize answers, propose wordplay explanations, and verify solutions through codified reasoning steps.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset, with interpretable reasoning provided in Python.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a successful application of LLMs for solving cryptic crosswords, offering both high performance and transparency in reasoning.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

*Changyue Wang, Weihang Su, Qingyao Ai, Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RACE, a framework for detecting hallucinations in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by analyzing reasoning traces and answer consistency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs' reasoning traces can introduce hallucinations or inconsistencies, which current methods fail to detect, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: RACE evaluates reasoning traces using four signals: inter-sample consistency, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment, and internal coherence.

Result: RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines across datasets and LLMs.

Conclusion: RACE provides a robust, generalizable solution for detecting hallucinations in LRMs, even when answers seem correct.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MockConf, a dataset for simultaneous interpreting, and InterAlign, a web-based tool for annotation and alignment, addressing gaps in existing resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parallel corpora and alignment tools fail to model long-range interactions and specific divergences in simultaneous interpreting, necessitating dedicated datasets and tools.

Method: The authors collected MockConf, a 7-hour dataset from student mock conferences, and developed InterAlign, a web-based tool for word and span alignment.

Result: The dataset includes recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned, with proposed metrics and a baseline for automatic alignment.

Conclusion: The released dataset and tools aim to support analysis, monitoring, and evaluation of simultaneous interpreting, filling a critical gap in the field.

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, GPT-3.5) to automate MCQ generation in education, finding GPT-3.5 most effective, though AI adoption hesitancy remains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MCQ generation is time-consuming; LLMs offer a scalable solution while allowing educator control over content.

Method: Comparative analysis of three LLMs, injecting knowledge into prompts to avoid hallucinations, tested by 21 educators.

Result: GPT-3.5 outperformed others in generating effective MCQs, but reluctance to adopt AI in education persists.

Conclusion: LLMs, especially GPT-3.5, show promise for MCQ generation, enhancing education, though adoption barriers need addressing.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

*Dávid Javorský, Ondřej Bojar, François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines isometric machine translation using LLMs, focusing on prompt strategies, few-shot examples, and demonstration selection. Key findings include the importance of instruction phrasing for length control and marginal gains beyond 5-shot prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs perform in isometric translation tasks and how prompting strategies affect translation quality and length control.

Method: Used eight open-source LLMs of varying sizes, tested different prompting strategies, few-shot examples (5, 10, 20), and demonstration selection for En→De, En→Fr, and En→Es translations.

Result: Instruction phrasing aligned with demonstrations is crucial for length control. LLMs produce shorter translations only with extreme examples. Few-shot prompting improves quality but with diminishing returns. Multiple outputs enhance the length-quality tradeoff.

Conclusion: Effective prompting and demonstration selection are key for isometric translation. LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art performance with optimized strategies, though length control remains challenging.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

TL;DR: Integrating Universal Dependencies (UD) into pretrained language models improves performance on cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification, with significant accuracy and F1 score gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored effectiveness of UD in improving pretrained language models for cross-lingual tasks.

Method: Integration of UD into pretrained language models and evaluation on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification task.

Result: UD integration yields average accuracy and F1 score gains of 3.85% and 6.08%, reducing performance gaps and sometimes outperforming large language models.

Conclusion: UD is valid and promising for out-of-domain tasks, with performance correlated to UD-based similarity scores between languages.

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICPC-Eval is a competitive coding benchmark for evaluating LLMs in real competition scenarios, addressing gaps in current benchmarks and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks and metrics fail to assess LLMs' coding and reflective reasoning abilities in competitive environments.

Method: ICPC-Eval includes 118 ICPC contest problems, a robust test case generation method, and a new metric, Refine@K, for iterative solution repair.

Result: Top-tier LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 require multi-turn feedback to excel, but still trail top human teams in coding contests.

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval highlights the challenges in evaluating LLMs' reasoning and shows they lag behind humans in competitive coding.

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

### [65] [Verbose ListOps (VLO): Beyond Long Context -- Unmasking LLM's Reasoning Blind Spots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04907)
*Alex Pan, Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps is a new benchmark designed to test LLMs' nested narrative reasoning by converting ListOps computations into lengthy stories, revealing their struggle with state management and intermediate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately test LLMs' nested reasoning due to unrealistic distractors or conflated context length and complexity, masking a key limitation.

Method: Verbose ListOps programmatically transforms ListOps computations into coherent narratives, controlling narrative size and reasoning difficulty while withholding intermediate results.

Result: Leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) perform poorly on Verbose ListOps at modest narrative lengths (~10k tokens), despite excelling at raw ListOps.

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps highlights LLMs' vulnerability in nested reasoning and state management, offering a framework for targeted improvements beyond context expansion, crucial for real-world knowledge automation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

*Junior Cedric Tonga, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Kaushal Kumar Maurya, Fajri Koto, Ekaterina Kochmar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can provide multilingual instructional feedback, improving learning outcomes, especially in low-resource languages when feedback matches the student's native language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' effectiveness in providing instructional support across diverse languages, particularly for math reasoning tasks.

Method: Simulated tutor-student interactions using LLMs across 11 languages, testing feedback alignment, model choice, and resource levels.

Result: Multilingual hints boost learning, especially in low-resource languages with native-language feedback.

Conclusion: LLMs can enhance multilingual educational tools, ensuring inclusivity and effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConECT, a Czech-to-Polish e-commerce dataset with images and metadata, and shows that adding contextual information (visual or textual) improves NMT translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NMT struggles with word ambiguity and context, especially in domain-specific applications like e-commerce with unclear sentences or poor data quality.

Method: Created ConECT dataset (11,400 sentence pairs with images/metadata) and tested vision-language models and text-to-text models with contextual info (e.g., category paths, image descriptions).

Result: Incorporating contextual information (visual or textual) improves translation quality.

Conclusion: Contextual information enhances NMT performance, and the ConECT dataset is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Motivation: To assess LLMs' capabilities in solving complex algorithmic problems and their potential to support advanced algorithm education.

Method: Testing multiple LLMs on Romanian and English-translated university-level algorithms exams, analyzing problem-solving, consistency, and multilingual performance.

Result: Recent LLMs achieve scores comparable to top students and show robust reasoning, but face challenges with graph-based tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs hold promise for educational support, particularly in feedback and content generation, paving the way for further AI integration in algorithm education.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of
state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging university-level

complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges, even though difficulties remain
with graph-based tasks. Building on these findings, we explore the potential of
LLMs to support educational environments through the generation of high-quality
editorial content, offering instructors a powerful tool to enhance student
feedback. The insights and best practices discussed herein pave the way for

*Yongjie Xiao, Hongru Liang, Peixin Qin, Yao Zhang, Wenqiang Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCOP evaluates LLMs' comprehension skills from a cognitive perspective, revealing gaps in expert-level performance and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs' comprehension aligns with expert processes, given their potential but lack of rational explanation in real-world use.

Method: Proposes SCOP, a framework with five defined comprehension skills, strict testing data construction, and analysis of open/closed-source LLMs.

Result: LLMs struggle with expert-level comprehension, show biases (e.g., better at local than global info), and may produce correct answers via flawed processes.

Conclusion: Improving LLMs requires focusing on thorough development of comprehension skills during training.

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

TL;DR: A simple method to control text summary length by adjusting EOS token prediction importance in loss computation, compatible with various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlling text length are complex and incompatible with pre-trained models, necessitating a simpler solution.

Method: Adjusts the importance of predicting the EOS token in cross-entropy loss to control summary length, without altering model architecture.

Result: Effective length control in summaries without quality loss, tested on encoder-decoder and GPT-style models.

Conclusion: The proposed method is simple, architecture-agnostic, and effective for length control in text generation.

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

TL;DR: AR-Checker is a framework for testing LLM robustness by generating semantic-preserving mathematical problem variants, minimizing data contamination risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLM robustness issues in simple reasoning tasks and avoid data contamination from hand-crafted evaluations.

Method: Uses multi-round parallel LLM-based rewriting and verification to generate problem variants.

Result: Strong performance on GSM8K, MATH-500, MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and CommonsenseQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: AR-Checker effectively evaluates LLM robustness across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in low-resource languages due to limited training data, prompting the need for an efficient enhancement method.

Method: TALL combines an LLM with bilingual translation models, using dimension alignment and custom transformers to process low-resource inputs.

Result: Experiments on Hebrew show TALL outperforms baselines like direct use, naive translation, and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TALL offers a parameter-efficient solution for improving LLM performance in low-resource languages without extensive retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle
with low-resource languages due to limited training data. This paper presents
TALL (Trainable Architecture for Enhancing LLM Performance in Low-Resource
Languages), which integrates an LLM with two bilingual translation models. TALL
transforms low-resource inputs into high-resource representations, leveraging
the LLM's capabilities while preserving linguistic features through dimension
alignment layers and custom transformers. Our experiments on Hebrew demonstrate
significant improvements over several baselines, including direct use, naive
translation, and fine-tuning approaches. The architecture employs a
parameter-efficient strategy, freezing pre-trained components while training
only lightweight adapter modules, balancing computational efficiency with
performance gains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Debate Speech Evaluation as a benchmark for LLM judges, analyzing their performance against human judges using a dataset of 600 annotated speeches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to evaluate debate speeches, a task requiring deep understanding of argument strength, coherence, and style, which has been understudied in LLM benchmarking.

Method: Leveraged a dataset of 600 annotated debate speeches to compare state-of-the-art LLMs with human judges, analyzing their judgment behavior and speech generation capabilities.

Result: Larger LLMs approximate human judgments in some aspects but differ overall. Frontier LLMs can generate persuasive speeches at human-level performance.

Conclusion: Debate Speech Evaluation highlights LLMs' nuanced performance in complex evaluation tasks, with potential for human-level speech generation.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

### [75] [Does It Make Sense to Speak of Introspection in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05068)
*Iulia Comşa, Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether LLMs' self-reports can be considered introspection, analyzing two examples—one invalid and one minimal but legitimate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how to interpret self-reports from LLMs and assess if introspection applies to them.

Method: Critique of two examples of LLM self-reports: one describing creative writing (invalid) and one inferring its temperature parameter (minimal introspection).

Result: The first example is not valid introspection; the second is a minimal case, likely without consciousness.

Conclusion: Introspection can be minimally applied to LLMs, but without implying consciousness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RIVAL, an adversarial training framework, improves LLM performance in colloquial subtitle translation by addressing distributional shift between the RM and LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The poor performance of RLHF combined with LLMs in colloquial subtitle translation tasks due to distributional shift between the RM and LLM.

Method: Proposes RIVAL, a min-max adversarial training framework where the RM distinguishes strong/weak translations and the LLM improves to close the gap, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative rewards.

Result: RIVAL significantly outperforms baseline methods in translation tasks.

Conclusion: The adversarial training framework effectively mitigates distributional shift and enhances translation quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CESM-100 and SHINES to improve LLMs' detection of self-harm intent on social media by analyzing language-emoji interplay, achieving better performance and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of self-harm on social media is vital for suicide prevention, but LLMs struggle with implicit cues in casual language and emojis.

Method: The framework uses CESM-100 to enrich inputs, fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning (self-harm detection and intent span detection), and generates explainable rationales.

Result: The approach enhances LLM performance in detection and explanation tasks, addressing ambiguity in self-harm signals.

Conclusion: The SHINES dataset and CESM-100 improve LLMs' ability to detect and explain self-harm intent, aiding timely intervention.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

TL;DR: The study uses AI to analyze how street features like vehicle density, greenery, and cleanliness affect retail performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Findings show vehicle presence and street width impact commercial vitality, while greenery and cleanliness boost satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how street-level features influence commercial vitality and user satisfaction in urban communities, leveraging AI for perceptual urban diagnostics.

Method: An image-based framework using street view imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B) to construct a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) and analyze spatial attributes via GPT-4-based perception modeling.

Result: Moderate vehicle presence aids commercial access, but excessive parking harms walkability and satisfaction. Greenery and cleanliness boost satisfaction but weakly affect pricing. Street width moderates vehicle impacts.

Conclusion: The study highlights AI's role in urban diagnostics, showing how vehicle activity and spatial configuration shape commercial success, with implications for urban design and parking management.

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CL-ISR, a framework combining contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning to detect misleading texts on social media more accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misleading texts on social media can cause public misunderstanding, panic, and economic losses, necessitating improved detection methods.

Method: The framework uses contrastive learning to capture semantic differences and implicit stance reasoning to analyze stance tendencies and topic relationships.

Result: CL-ISR enhances detection accuracy by leveraging discriminative and interpretive capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves misleading text detection by combining contrastive learning and stance reasoning.

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent reasoning framework, improves zero-shot event detection by combining open-ended discovery (Dreamer) and task-aligned reasoning (Grounder), outperforming baselines by 4-7% F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot event detection is challenging for LLMs due to complex event ontologies and domain-specific triggers. DiCoRe addresses this by decoupling the task into divergent and convergent reasoning.

Method: DiCoRe uses Dreamer for open-ended event discovery (divergent reasoning) and Grounder for task-aligned predictions (convergent reasoning). An LLM-Judge ensures precision.

Result: Experiments on six datasets across five domains show DiCoRe outperforms baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains.

Conclusion: DiCoRe is a robust zero-shot event detection framework, enhancing LLM utility for domain-specific document understanding.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

### [81] [Information Locality as an Inductive Bias for Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05136)
*Taiga Someya, Anej Svete, Brian DuSell, Timothy J. O'Donnell, Mario Giulianelli, Ryan Cotterell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to study inductive biases in neural language models (LMs) using $m$-local entropy, showing that higher entropy makes learning harder for LMs, aligning with human sensitivity to local language structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantitatively investigate whether neural LMs' inductive biases align with human language processing constraints.

Method: Introduces $m$-local entropy, an information-theoretic measure, and tests it on perturbed natural language corpora and PFSA-defined languages using Transformer and LSTM LMs.

Result: Higher $m$-local entropy languages are harder for LMs to learn, indicating sensitivity to local statistical structure.

Conclusion: Neural LMs, like humans, are sensitive to local language structure, suggesting alignment in processing constraints.

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

### [82] [Do Large Language Models Judge Error Severity Like Humans?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05142)
*Diege Sun, Guanyi Chen, Fan Zhao, Xiaorong Cheng, Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs as evaluators struggle to match human judgments of error severity in image descriptions, with notable mismatches in gender and color errors. Only Doubao and DeepSeek-V3 show partial alignment with human assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can accurately replicate human judgments of error severity in image descriptions, especially in unimodal and multimodal settings.

Method: Extended van Miltenburg et al.'s framework to compare human and LLM assessments of semantic errors (age, gender, clothing type, color) in text-only and text + image contexts.

Result: Humans vary severity by error type, with visual context amplifying severity for color and type errors. LLMs often misjudge gender and color severity, except Doubao (partial alignment) and DeepSeek-V3 (best alignment).

Conclusion: LLMs may internalize social norms (gender) but lack perceptual grounding (color). DeepSeek-V3 outperforms multimodal models, suggesting unimodal models can align well with human judgments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Knowledgeable-r1 improves RAG by balancing retrieved contexts and model knowledge, enhancing robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems overly rely on retrieved contexts, risking inaccuracies and ignoring model knowledge.

Method: Proposes Knowledgeable-r1 with joint sampling and multi-policy distributions to integrate parametric and contextual knowledge.

Result: Significantly boosts robustness and reasoning accuracy, outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual scenarios.

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1 effectively balances knowledge sources, improving RAG performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how social, demographic, and gender biases are structurally represented in LLMs like GPT-2 and Llama2, identifying localized components responsible for biases and their impact on other NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate biases in LLMs by examining their structural representation and effects on model behavior.

Method: Mechanistic interpretability approach to identify bias-related edges, assess their stability and localization, and perform systematic ablations.

Result: Biases are highly localized in specific layers, components vary with fine-tuning, and their removal reduces bias but affects other NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Bias-related computations are concentrated in specific model components, and their removal has broader implications for model performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

*Yeonseok Jeong, Jinsu Kim, Dohyeon Lee, Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECoRAG improves LLM-based Open-Domain Question Answering by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, enhancing performance and cost-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior compression methods in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fail to filter non-evidential information, limiting LLM performance.

Method: Proposes ECoRAG, a framework that compresses documents based on evidentiality and retrieves more if evidence is insufficient.

Result: ECoRAG outperforms existing methods in ODQA tasks, reducing latency and token usage.

Conclusion: ECoRAG is a cost-efficient solution for improving LLM performance in RAG by focusing on evidentiality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

TL;DR: The Qwen3 Embedding series improves text embedding and reranking using Qwen3 foundation models, with multi-stage training and model merging for robustness. It offers scalable model sizes and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like MTEB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance text embedding and reranking capabilities by leveraging Qwen3 LLMs' multilingual understanding and generation, addressing diverse deployment needs.

Method: Uses a multi-stage training pipeline combining unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, with Qwen3 LLMs synthesizing diverse training data and enabling model merging.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MTEB and retrieval tasks, with scalable models (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for efficiency or effectiveness.

Conclusion: The Qwen3 Embedding series is a robust, adaptable solution for embedding and reranking, publicly available under Apache 2.0 to support community research.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are

TL;DR: The paper explores in-context counterfactual reasoning in large-scale neural language models, demonstrating their ability to predict outcomes under hypothetical scenarios using a synthetic linear regression task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models perform counterfactual reasoning without parameter updates, focusing on noise abduction in a controlled setup.

Method: A synthetic linear regression task requiring noise abduction, analyzing the role of self-attention, model depth, and pre-training data diversity in Transformers.

Result: Language models successfully perform counterfactual reasoning, with performance driven by self-attention, depth, and data diversity. The findings extend to sequential data, hinting at potential for counterfactual story generation.

Conclusion: Transformers can perform counterfactual reasoning by transforming in-context observations, with implications for broader applications like story generation.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

*Jackson Petty, Michael Y. Hu, Wentao Wang, Shauli Ravfogel, William Merrill, Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The RELIC framework evaluates LLMs' instruction-following ability using language recognition, revealing their limitations with complex grammars and reliance on heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to follow instructions without input-output examples, focusing on language recognition tasks.

Method: Introduces RELIC, a framework for evaluating LLMs on synthetic language recognition tasks with scalable complexity.

Result: LLMs show near-chance performance on complex grammars, relying on shallow heuristics as task difficulty increases.

Conclusion: RELIC highlights LLMs' current limitations in instruction following and provides a tool for future evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Common Pile v0.1, an 8TB openly licensed text dataset for LLM training, addressing ethical and legal concerns of unlicensed data. Two 7B parameter models trained on this dataset perform competitively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate intellectual property and ethical issues in LLM training by using openly licensed text, as prior datasets were insufficient in size or quality.

Method: Collected and curated 8TB of openly licensed text from 30 diverse sources, then trained two 7B parameter LLMs (Comma v0.1-1T and v0.1-2T) on 1T and 2T tokens respectively.

Result: Both models achieved competitive performance compared to unlicensed-data-trained LLMs like Llama 1 and 2 7B.

Conclusion: The Common Pile v0.1 and associated models demonstrate that openly licensed data can effectively train high-performance LLMs, offering a legal and ethical alternative.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

TL;DR: Self-supervised tasks like autoencoding and CMLM improve morphological inflection in low-resource languages, with performance varying by data availability. Masking based on morpheme boundaries enhances results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore self-supervised objectives for character-level tasks like morphological inflection in low-resource languages, where labeled data is scarce.

Method: Train encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages using 13 auxiliary self-supervised tasks, comparing autoencoding and CMLM.

Result: Autoencoding works best with very limited data, while CMLM excels as data increases. Masking by morpheme boundaries consistently improves performance.

Conclusion: Self-supervised tasks are effective for low-resource morphological modeling, with CMLM and morpheme-based masking being particularly promising.

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

*Ratna Kandala, Prakash Mondal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified system for analyzing syntactic discontinuity and continuity in natural languages by integrating Phrase Structure Grammar, Dependency Grammar, and Categorial Grammar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified approach for analyzing discontinuous structures in linguistic theory, which are currently treated as independent systems.

Method: Combines representations from Phrase Structure Grammar (constituency), Dependency Grammar (head-dependent relations), and Categorial Grammar (functor-argument relations) into a single mathematical derivation.

Result: Demonstrates that both discontinuous and continuous structures can be analyzed through this unified framework.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers a cohesive method for representing syntactic discontinuity and continuity across languages.

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

TL;DR: Micro-Act improves QA accuracy in RAG systems by hierarchically decomposing knowledge conflicts into fine-grained comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing knowledge conflicts in RAG systems where retrieved external knowledge contradicts LLMs' parametric knowledge, harming QA performance.

Method: Proposes Micro-Act, a framework with a hierarchical action space to adaptively decompose knowledge sources into fine-grained comparisons for better reasoning.

Result: Achieves significant QA accuracy improvements over baselines across 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic conflicts.

Conclusion: Micro-Act is robust and practical for real-world RAG applications, excelling in both conflict and non-conflict scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

*Ron Eliav, Arie Cattan, Eran Hirsch, Shahaf Bassan, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal, Ido Dagan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a guided reasoning process for hallucination detection using LLMs, improving accuracy by decomposing text into smaller facts and verifying each against source evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLI-based hallucination detection lacks fine-grained reasoning, limiting accuracy. Explicit, systematic reasoning could enhance performance.

Method: A 3-step reasoning process: (i) claim decomposition, (ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, (iii) aggregated classification. Metrics evaluate intermediate steps.

Result: Guided reasoning improves hallucination detection accuracy, supported by empirical evidence from intermediate metrics.

Conclusion: Systematic reasoning enhances LLM performance in hallucination detection, validated by improved results and intermediate step analysis.

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

TL;DR: ProRefine is a prompt optimization method for AI agent workflows, improving performance by refining prompts dynamically using LLM feedback, achieving significant accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address error propagation and sub-optimal performance in agentic workflows due to poorly designed prompts, limiting reliability and scalability.

Method: ProRefine uses textual feedback from LLMs to dynamically refine prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without extra training or labels.

Result: Outperforms zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3-37 percentage points on five mathematical reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: ProRefine enhances accuracy, enables smaller models to match larger ones, and supports scalable, efficient AI deployment.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

*Taha Entesari, Arman Hatami, Rinat Khaziev, Anil Ramakrishna, Mahyar Fazlyab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constrained optimization method for unlearning in LLMs, using a novel logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and a hard constraint for retention, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need to unlearn sensitive or outdated data, but current methods suffer from unstable optimization and degraded performance.

Method: Formulates unlearning as constrained optimization with a logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and a hard constraint for retention, solved via a primal-dual algorithm.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, effectively removing targeted data while preserving utility.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a stable and efficient solution for LLM unlearning, balancing forgetting and retention effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Search Arena, a large-scale dataset for evaluating search-augmented LLMs, revealing user preferences and credibility gaps in cited content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for search-augmented LLMs are limited in scale and scope, prompting the need for a more comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: A crowd-sourced dataset of 24,000 multi-turn interactions with human preference votes was created, spanning diverse intents and languages.

Result: User preferences are influenced by citation quantity and source type, with community-driven platforms favored over static encyclopedic sources. Search-augmented LLMs perform well in non-search settings but struggle in search-intensive tasks without web search.

Conclusion: The dataset highlights gaps in perceived vs. actual credibility and the importance of source diversity, supporting future research in search-augmented LLMs.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

*Anirudh Bharadwaj, Chaitanya Malaviya, Nitish Joshi, Mark Yatskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models exhibit biases in preference judgments due to training data artifacts, favoring superficial features over substance. A method using counterfactual data augmentation reduces these biases effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address systematic miscalibration in language models' preference judgments, which prioritize superficial patterns over substantive qualities, leading to unreliable evaluations.

Method: Systematically investigate training data biases and propose counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized contrastive examples to debias preference models.

Result: CDA reduces miscalibration from 39.4% to 32.5% and skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%, maintaining performance on RewardBench.

Conclusion: Targeted debiasing via CDA is effective for building reliable preference models, mitigating biases while preserving evaluation quality.

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

*Dimitri Coelho Mollo, Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper distinguishes five notions of grounding in LLMs, focusing on referential grounding, and argues LLMs can achieve it through fine-tuning or pre-training, without requiring multimodality or embodiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the Vector Grounding Problem in LLMs, clarifying whether their outputs can have intrinsic meaning without external interpretation.

Method: Distinguishes five grounding notions, focusing on referential grounding, and provides philosophical arguments for LLMs achieving it via fine-tuning or pre-training.

Result: LLMs can achieve referential grounding through specific methods, and multimodality/embodiment are not essential for solving the Grounding Problem.

Conclusion: LLMs can establish intrinsic meaning through referential grounding, challenging assumptions about the necessity of multimodality or embodiment.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex
linguistic tasks has sparked debate about their capabilities. Unlike humans,
these models learn language solely from textual data without directly
interacting with the world. Yet they generate seemingly meaningful text on
diverse topics. This achievement has renewed interest in the classical `Symbol
Grounding Problem' -- the question of whether the internal representations and
outputs of symbolic AI systems can possess intrinsic meaning that is not
parasitic on external interpretation. Although modern LLMs compute over vectors
rather than symbols, an analogous problem arises for these systems, which we
call the Vector Grounding Problem. This paper has two main goals. First, we
distinguish five main notions of grounding that are often conflated in the
literature, and argue that only one of them, which we call referential
grounding, is relevant to the Vector Grounding Problem. Second, drawing on
philosophical theories of representational content, we provide two arguments
for the claim that LLMs and related systems can achieve referential grounding:
(1) through preference fine-tuning methods that explicitly establish
world-involving functions, and (2) through pre-training alone, which in limited
domains may select for internal states with world-involving content, as
mechanistic interpretability research suggests. Through these pathways, LLMs
can establish connections to the world sufficient for intrinsic meaning. One
potentially surprising implication of our discussion is that that multimodality
and embodiment are neither necessary nor sufficient to overcome the Grounding
Problem.

*Kristian Lum, Jacy Reese Anthis, Kevin Robinson, Chirag Nagpal, Alexander D'Amour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Standard benchmarks for bias in LLMs don't reliably predict bias in realistic, long-form interactions. RUTEd evaluations show no correlation with traditional metrics, urging context-specific assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if standard bias benchmarks in LLMs hold up in realistic, long-form interactions, addressing gaps in current evaluations.

Method: Adapted three standard bias metrics and developed RUTEd evaluations for real-world contexts (bedtime stories, personas, language exercises).

Result: No significant correlation between standard bias metrics and RUTEd evaluations; traditional benchmarks fail as proxies for real-world bias.

Conclusion: Standard benchmarks lack reliability for real-world bias; context-specific evaluations are needed for accurate assessment.

Abstract: Standard benchmarks of bias and fairness in large language models (LLMs)
measure the association between the user attributes stated or implied by a
prompt and the LLM's short text response, but human-AI interaction increasingly
requires long-form and context-specific system output to solve real-world
tasks. In the commonly studied domain of gender-occupation bias, we test
whether these benchmarks are robust to lengthening the LLM responses as a
measure of Realistic Use and Tangible Effects (i.e., RUTEd evaluations). From
the current literature, we adapt three standard bias metrics (neutrality, skew,
and stereotype) and develop analogous RUTEd evaluations from three contexts of
real-world use: children's bedtime stories, user personas, and English language
learning exercises. We find that standard bias metrics have no significant
correlation with the more realistic bias metrics. For example, selecting the
least biased model based on the standard "trick tests" coincides with selecting
the least biased model as measured in more realistic use no more than random
chance. We suggest that there is not yet evidence to justify standard
benchmarks as reliable proxies of real-world AI biases, and we encourage
further development of evaluations grounded in particular contexts.

TL;DR: Mosaic-IT introduces a human/model-free method to create diverse instruction-response pairs, improving LLM performance and reducing training costs by 80%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction tuning relies on costly and non-sustainable teacher models or human intervention, lacking diversity.

Method: Mosaic-IT randomly concatenates existing instruction data and trains models with meta-instructions to enhance multi-step and format-following skills.

Result: Achieves superior performance and 80% reduction in training costs compared to original instruction tuning.

Conclusion: Mosaic-IT efficiently enhances LLMs with rich, diverse data, offering cost-effective and scalable improvements.

Abstract: Finetuning large language models with a variety of instruction-response pairs
has enhanced their capability to understand and follow instructions. Current
instruction tuning primarily relies on teacher models or human intervention to
generate and refine the instructions and responses for training, which are
costly, non-sustainable, and may lack diversity. In this paper, we introduce
Mosaic Instruction Tuning (Mosaic-IT), a human/model-free compositional data
synthesis method that can efficiently create rich and diverse augmentations
from existing instruction tuning data to enhance the LLMs. Mosaic-IT randomly
concatenates multiple instruction data into one and trains the model to produce
the corresponding responses with predefined higher-level meta-instructions to
strengthen its multi-step instruction-following and format-following skills.
Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a superior performance and training
efficiency of Mosaic-IT, which achieves consistent performance improvements
over various benchmarks and an 80% reduction in training costs compared with
original instruction tuning. Our codes and data are available at

TL;DR: CheckEmbed (CE) is a scalable and accurate method for verifying LLM outputs by embedding answers into vectors for fast, semantic comparisons, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verifying LLM outputs for complex tasks is challenging; existing methods like BERTScore and SelfCheckGPT have limitations in accuracy and scalability.

Method: CE reduces LLM answers to embedding vectors using modern models like SFR-Embedding-Mistral, enabling whole-answer level comparisons.

Result: CE outperforms 13 baselines, detecting hallucinations effectively in various tasks and generalizing to other modalities like vision.

Conclusion: CE is a practical, versatile verification framework for LLM outputs, addressing key limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming a wide range of domains, yet
verifying their outputs remains a significant challenge, especially for complex
open-ended tasks such as consolidation, summarization, and knowledge
extraction. To address this, we introduce CheckEmbed (CE): a simple, scalable,
and accurate verification method. CE reduces each LLM answer to a single
embedding vector using powerful modern embedding LLM models like
SFR-Embedding-Mistral. Prior methods such as BERTScore and SelfCheckGPT relied
on weaker encoders like BERT, forcing them to operate at token or sentence
granularity. In contrast, CE performs fast, semantically rich comparisons
directly at the whole-answer level, overcoming key limitations in both accuracy
and scalability. We conduct a comprehensive design and time complexity analysis
across 13 verification baselines, including classical text scorers (e.g.,
BLEU), stability-based methods (e.g., SelfCheckGPT), and generative evaluators
(e.g., LLM-as-a-Judge), which highlights the effectiveness, efficiency,
versatility, and simplicity of CE. Empirical results show that CE reliably
detects hallucinations in both closed and open-ended tasks. We further present
evidence that CE generalizes beyond text to other modalities such as vision,
establishing it as a practical and versatile verification framework.

TL;DR: The paper explores challenges in evaluating and ensuring fairness in large language models (LLMs), highlighting inherent difficulties in existing fairness frameworks and suggesting future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of general-purpose AI systems like LLMs has raised moral concerns about bias and fairness, prompting the need for rigorous evaluation methods.

Method: The authors analyze various technical fairness frameworks, identifying their limitations in the context of LLMs due to unstructured data and diverse human populations.

Result: They find that current frameworks are either impractical or logically flawed for general-purpose AI, though fairness remains a critical evaluation metric.

Conclusion: The paper suggests promising research directions, including developer responsibility standards, context-specific evaluations, and participatory AI-assisted methods.

Abstract: The rise of general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems,
particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised pressing moral questions
about how to reduce bias and ensure fairness at scale. Researchers have
documented a sort of "bias" in the significant correlations between
demographics (e.g., race, gender) in LLM prompts and responses, but it remains
unclear how LLM fairness could be evaluated with more rigorous definitions,
such as group fairness or fair representations. We analyze a variety of
technical fairness frameworks and find inherent challenges in each that make
the development of a fair LLM intractable. We show that each framework either
does not logically extend to the general-purpose AI context or is infeasible in
practice, primarily due to the large amounts of unstructured training data and
the many potential combinations of human populations, use cases, and sensitive
attributes. These inherent challenges would persist for general-purpose AI,
including LLMs, even if empirical challenges, such as limited participatory
input and limited measurement methods, were overcome. Nonetheless, fairness
will remain an important type of model evaluation, and there are still
promising research directions, particularly the development of standards for
the responsibility of LLM developers, context-specific evaluations, and methods
of iterative, participatory, and AI-assisted evaluation that could scale
fairness across the diverse contexts of modern human-AI interaction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MRAG improves RAG by using multi-head attention activations to fetch diverse documents for complex queries, achieving up to 20% better retrieval success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG struggles with queries needing diverse documents due to distant embeddings. MRAG addresses this gap.

Method: MRAG leverages Transformer's multi-head attention activations as keys to retrieve multi-aspect documents.

Result: MRAG outperforms 18 baselines, improving retrieval success by up to 20% and enhancing LLM generation.

Conclusion: MRAG is effective for complex queries, integrates easily with existing RAG frameworks, and offers significant improvements.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to
provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not
focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with
substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are
challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the
embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces
Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a
simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head
attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching
multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention
heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding
activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items
and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide
an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world
use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages
over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success
ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly
integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates domain-adapted sentence embeddings for telecom QA, showing improved accuracy and tighter confidence intervals after fine-tuning. It introduces metrics for similarity distribution and finds isotropy poorly correlated with performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Choosing effective sentence embeddings for technical domains like telecom is challenging due to specialized vocabulary.

Method: Domain adaptation of embeddings using telecom data, evaluation of public models and fine-tuned variants, and introduction of metrics for similarity distribution.

Result: Fine-tuning improves accuracy and confidence intervals; isotropy metrics poorly correlate with retrieval performance.

Conclusion: Provides recommendations for using the methodology and metrics, emphasizing the benefits of fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: A plethora of sentence embedding models makes it challenging to choose one,
especially for technical domains rich with specialized vocabulary. In this
work, we domain adapt embeddings using telecom data for question answering. We
evaluate embeddings obtained from publicly available models and their
domain-adapted variants, on both point retrieval accuracies, as well as their
(95%) confidence intervals. We establish a systematic method to obtain
thresholds for similarity scores for different embeddings. As expected, we
observe that fine-tuning improves mean bootstrapped accuracies. We also observe
that it results in tighter confidence intervals, which further improve when
pre-training is preceded by fine-tuning. We introduce metrics which measure the
distributional overlaps of top-$K$, correct and random document similarities
with the question. Further, we show that these metrics are correlated with
retrieval accuracy and similarity thresholds. Recent literature shows
conflicting effects of isotropy on retrieval accuracies. Our experiments
establish that the isotropy of embeddings (as measured by two independent
state-of-the-art isotropy metric definitions) is poorly correlated with
retrieval performance. We show that embeddings for domain-specific sentences
have little overlap with those for domain-agnostic ones, and fine-tuning moves
them further apart. Based on our results, we provide recommendations for use of
our methodology and metrics by researchers and practitioners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs for Bangla Grammatical Error Correction (GEC), creating a dataset (Vaiyakarana) with rule-based noise injection, and shows improved GEC performance after instruction-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Bangla being the fifth most-spoken language, GEC for Bangla is underdeveloped. The study aims to leverage LLMs to address this gap.

Method: Categorized 12 Bangla error classes, collected real-world errors via surveys, and created a dataset (Vaiyakarana) using rule-based noise injection. Instruction-tuned LLMs with this dataset.

Result: Instruction-tuning improved GEC performance by 3-7 percentage points over zero-shot, achieving human-like error identification but not surpassing humans in correction.

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly improve Bangla GEC, especially in error identification, though human correction remains superior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform exceedingly well in Natural Language
Understanding (NLU) tasks for many languages including English. However,
despite being the fifth most-spoken language globally, Grammatical Error
Correction (GEC) in Bangla remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate
how LLMs can be leveraged for improving Bangla GEC. For that, we first do an
extensive categorization of 12 error classes in Bangla, and take a survey of
native Bangla speakers to collect real-world errors. We next devise a
rule-based noise injection method to create grammatically incorrect sentences
corresponding to correct ones. The Vaiyakarana dataset, thus created, consists
of 5,67,422 sentences of which 2,27,119 are erroneous. This dataset is then
used to instruction-tune LLMs for the task of GEC in Bangla. Evaluations show
that instruction-tuning with \name improves GEC performance of LLMs by 3-7
percentage points as compared to the zero-shot setting, and makes them achieve
human-like performance in grammatical error identification. Humans, though,
remain superior in error correction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in generalization, controllability, diversity, and truthfulness in LLM-generated datasets.

Method: Uses attribute-guided generation, group checking, code-based label verification, retrieval-augmented generation, and user-specified constraints.

Result: Produces high-quality datasets, enhances benchmarking, and improves LLM capabilities through data augmentation.

Conclusion: DataGen effectively addresses key challenges in synthetic data generation and supports practical applications like benchmarking and augmentation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama3 have significantly
impacted various fields by enabling high-quality synthetic data generation and
reducing dependence on expensive human-generated datasets. Despite this,
challenges remain in the areas of generalization, controllability, diversity,
and truthfulness within the existing generative frameworks. To address these
challenges, this paper presents DataGen, a comprehensive LLM-powered framework
designed to produce diverse, accurate, and highly controllable datasets.
DataGen is adaptable, supporting all types of text datasets and enhancing the
generative process through innovative mechanisms. To augment data diversity,
DataGen incorporates an attribute-guided generation module and a group checking
feature. For accuracy, it employs a code-based mathematical assessment for
label verification alongside a retrieval-augmented generation technique for
factual validation. The framework also allows for user-specified constraints,
enabling customization of the data generation process to suit particular
requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of data
generated by DataGen, and each module within DataGen plays a critical role in
this enhancement. Additionally, DataGen is applied in two practical scenarios:
benchmarking LLMs and data augmentation. The results indicate that DataGen
effectively supports dynamic and evolving benchmarking and that data
augmentation improves LLM capabilities in various domains, including
agent-oriented abilities and reasoning skills.

Motivation: Existing lexicon induction methods fail to capture the evolving nature and social structure of in-group language.

Conclusion: The approach provides novel insights into in-group language, demonstrating its utility.

Abstract: In-group language is an important signifier of group dynamics. This paper
proposes a novel method for inducing lexicons of in-group language, which
incorporates its socio-temporal context. Existing methods for lexicon induction
do not capture the evolving nature of in-group language, nor the social
structure of the community. Using dynamic word and user embeddings trained on
conversations from online anti-women communities, our approach outperforms
prior methods for lexicon induction. We develop a test set for the task of
lexicon induction and a new lexicon of manosphere language, validated by human
experts, which quantifies the relevance of each term to a specific
sub-community at a given point in time. Finally, we present novel insights on
in-group language which illustrate the utility of this approach.

TL;DR: SAMI, a pluralistic alignment method, outperforms DPO in multi-task settings but shows mixed results compared to SFT in mathematical accuracy. Combining SAMI with SFT yields additional improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for pluralistic alignment methods to steer language models towards individual preferences and attributes.

Method: Uses conditional mutual information (SAMI) to link behavioral preferences to model responses. Tested against DPO and SFT in multi-task and mathematical accuracy settings.

Result: SAMI beats DPO with a 57% win rate in multi-task benchmarks. For math accuracy, SAMI improves zero-shot performance by 1.1%, but SFT is better (3.2%). Combining both yields a 1.3% boost in multi-attempt settings.

Conclusion: SAMI is effective for pluralistic alignment, especially in multi-task scenarios, but SFT remains superior for mathematical accuracy. Combining both methods can enhance performance.

Abstract: There is a growing need for pluralistic alignment methods that can steer
language models towards individual attributes and preferences. One such method,
Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information (SAMI), uses conditional
mutual information to encourage the connection between behavioral preferences
and model responses. We conduct two experiments exploring SAMI in multi-task
settings. First, we compare SAMI to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a
multi-task benchmark (MT-Bench), using a stronger model to generate training
data for a weaker one across diverse categories (humanities, STEM, extraction,
coding, math, reasoning, and roleplay). Our results indicate that one iteration
of SAMI has a 57% win rate against DPO, with significant variation in
performance between task categories. Second, we examine SAMI's impact on
mathematical accuracy (GSM-8K) relative to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). While
SAMI increases zero-shot performance by 1.1%, SFT is more effective with a 3.2%
boost. However, SAMI shows interesting scaling trends. When given 10 attempts,
SAMI improves accuracy by 3.9%, while SFT achieves a 10.1% increase. Combining
SAMI with SFT yields an additional improvement of 1.3% in multi-attempt
settings, though single-attempt accuracy remains unchanged.

*Jiayi He, Hehai Lin, Qingyun Wang, Yi Fung, Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores self-correction in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), introducing a Self-Correction Learning (SCL) approach using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve model performance without external feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often produce flawed responses, and their self-correction abilities, especially for visual and linguistic tasks, are understudied compared to LLMs.

Method: The study proposes SCL, where VLMs generate and learn from self-correction data (preferred/disfavored samples) during inference and fine-tuning via DPO.

Result: VLMs struggle with iterative self-correction during inference alone but improve significantly when fine-tuned on categorized self-correction data.

Conclusion: Self-correction should enhance reasoning abilities through training, enabling direct high-quality responses without further refinement.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in visual
and language reasoning tasks, they invariably generate flawed responses.
Self-correction that instructs models to refine their outputs presents a
promising solution to this issue. Previous studies have mainly concentrated on
Large Language Models (LLMs), while the self-correction abilities of VLMs,
particularly concerning both visual and linguistic information, remain largely
unexamined. This study investigates the self-correction capabilities of VLMs
during both inference and fine-tuning stages. We introduce a Self-Correction
Learning (SCL) approach that enables VLMs to learn from their self-generated
self-correction data through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) without
relying on external feedback, facilitating self-improvement. Specifically, we
collect preferred and disfavored samples based on the correctness of initial
and refined responses, which are obtained by two-turn self-correction with VLMs
during the inference stage. Experimental results demonstrate that although VLMs
struggle to self-correct effectively during iterative inference without
additional fine-tuning and external feedback, they can enhance their
performance and avoid previous mistakes through preference fine-tuning when
their self-generated self-correction data are categorized into preferred and
disfavored samples. This study emphasizes that self-correction is not merely a
refinement process; rather, it should enhance the reasoning abilities of models
through additional training, enabling them to generate high-quality responses
directly without further refinement.

Method: Systematic evaluation of LLMs using generative and discriminative tasks focused on morphemes in agglutinative languages (e.g., Turkish, Finnish), testing models like GPT-4 and Gemini.

Result: LLMs perform poorly in morphological compositional generalization, especially with novel roots, and lack systematicity, trailing human performance significantly.

Conclusion: LLMs' morphological generalization is limited, highlighting gaps in their ability to replicate human-like linguistic creativity and compositionality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in
various natural language generation and understanding tasks. However, their
linguistic generalization capabilities remain questionable, raising doubts
about whether these models learn language similarly to humans. While humans
exhibit compositional generalization and linguistic creativity in language use,
the extent to which LLMs replicate these abilities, particularly in morphology,
is under-explored. In this work, we systematically investigate the
morphological generalization abilities of LLMs through the lens of
compositionality. We define morphemes as compositional primitives and design a
novel suite of generative and discriminative tasks to assess morphological
productivity and systematicity. Focusing on agglutinative languages such as
Turkish and Finnish, we evaluate several state-of-the-art instruction-finetuned
multilingual models, including GPT-4 and Gemini. Our analysis shows that LLMs
struggle with morphological compositional generalization particularly when
applied to novel word roots, with performance declining sharply as
morphological complexity increases. While models can identify individual
morphological combinations better than chance, their performance lacks
systematicity, leading to significant accuracy gaps compared to humans.

### [111] [Not All Options Are Created Equal: Textual Option Weighting for Token-Efficient LLM-Based Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12872)
*JongWoo Kim, SeongYeub Chu, Bryan Wong, Mun Yi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LOKT is a framework using textual categorical option weights (TCOW) to encode learner interaction histories, improving LLM-based knowledge tracing with better scalability and cost-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based KT methods struggle with representing full interaction histories in prompts, limiting scalability and increasing computational costs.

Method: LOKT encodes interaction histories as TCOW (textual categorical option weights), semantic labels like 'inadequate' for learner options.

Result: LOKT outperforms non-LLM and LLM-based KT models in cold-start and warm-start settings, with scalable and cost-efficient inference.

Conclusion: LOKT enhances interpretability and performance of LLMs in KT, even under token constraints, with open-source code available.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for
knowledge tracing (KT) due to their strong reasoning and generalization
abilities. While recent LLM-based KT methods have proposed new prompt formats,
they struggle to represent the full interaction histories of example learners
within a single prompt during in-context learning (ICL), resulting in limited
scalability and high computational cost under token constraints. In this work,
we present \textit{LLM-based Option-weighted Knowledge Tracing (LOKT)}, a
simple yet effective framework that encodes the interaction histories of
example learners in context as \textit{textual categorical option weights
(TCOW)}. TCOW are semantic labels (e.g., ``inadequate'') assigned to the
options selected by learners when answering questions, enhancing the
interpretability of LLMs. Experiments on multiple-choice datasets show that
LOKT outperforms existing non-LLM and LLM-based KT models in both cold-start
and warm-start settings. Moreover, LOKT enables scalable and cost-efficient
inference, achieving strong performance even under strict token constraints.

### [112] [Isolated Causal Effects of Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14812)
*Victoria Lin, Louis-Philippe Morency, Eli Ben-Michael*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for estimating the causal effects of language interventions on reader behaviors, addressing challenges like non-focal language approximation and omitted variable bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language changes impact reader perceptions and behaviors, formalizing causal effects of language interventions.

Method: Proposes a formal estimation framework, measures for evaluating non-focal language approximations, and sensitivity analysis for bias.

Result: Poor non-focal language approximation can bias effect estimates; framework validated on semi-synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The framework effectively recovers isolated effects and provides tools to assess bias in language intervention studies.

Abstract: As language technologies become widespread, it is important to understand how
changes in language affect reader perceptions and behaviors. These
relationships may be formalized as the isolated causal effect of some focal
language-encoded intervention (e.g., factual inaccuracies) on an external
outcome (e.g., readers' beliefs). In this paper, we introduce a formal
estimation framework for isolated causal effects of language. We show that a
core challenge of estimating isolated effects is the need to approximate all
non-focal language outside of the intervention. Drawing on the principle of
omitted variable bias, we provide measures for evaluating the quality of both
non-focal language approximations and isolated effect estimates themselves. We
find that poor approximation of non-focal language can lead to bias in the
corresponding isolated effect estimates due to omission of relevant variables,
and we show how to assess the sensitivity of effect estimates to such bias
along the two key axes of fidelity and overlap. In experiments on
semi-synthetic and real-world data, we validate the ability of our framework to
correctly recover isolated effects and demonstrate the utility of our proposed
measures.

*Ming Li, Yanhong Li, Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how fast vs. slow thinking (e.g., chain-of-thoughts) affects gradient patterns in LLM layers, showing slow thinking stabilizes learning and distinguishes correct reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of fast vs. slow thinking on layer-wise gradients in LLMs, especially in reasoning tasks like CoT.

Method: Analyzes gradient patterns across layers in LLMs trained with fast (no CoT) vs. slow (detailed CoT) thinking paths, and compares them in reasoning and non-reasoning tasks.

Result: Slow thinking leads to stable gradients and distinguishes correct reasoning paths, while fast thinking causes larger gradient variations. Non-reasoning tasks don't show similar effects.

Conclusion: Slow thinking enhances LLM training stability and reasoning accuracy, offering insights for developing generalizable System-2 agents.

Abstract: What makes a difference in the post-training of LLMs? We investigate the
training patterns of different layers in large language models (LLMs) through
the lens of the gradient. We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow
thinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of
training LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process
rewards. In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and
larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed
CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Additionally, we
study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses
when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results
show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant
reasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on
non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing
the response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking. Our
study strengthens fundamental understandings of LLM training and sheds novel
insights on its efficiency and stability, which pave the way towards building a
generalizable System-2 agent. Our code, data, and gradient statistics can be

*Ofir Zafrir, Igor Margulis, Dorin Shteyman, Shira Guskin, Guy Boudoukh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FastDraft introduces an efficient method to pre-train and align draft models for large language models, achieving significant speedups in inference tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the lack of efficient draft models for many language models due to vocabulary compatibility constraints.

Method: Incorporates efficient pre-training and fine-tuning over synthetic datasets generated by the target model.

Result: Achieves up to 3x speedup in code completion and 2x in summarization, with high acceptance rates and block efficiency.

Conclusion: FastDraft enables efficient inference for large language models on edge devices, reducing runtime significantly.

Abstract: Speculative Decoding has gained popularity as an effective technique for
accelerating the auto-regressive inference process of Large Language Models.
However, Speculative Decoding entirely relies on the availability of efficient
draft models, which are often lacking for many existing language models due to
a stringent constraint of vocabulary compatibility. In this work we introduce
FastDraft, a novel and efficient approach for pre-training and aligning a draft
model to any large language model by incorporating efficient pre-training,
followed by fine-tuning over synthetic datasets generated by the target model.
We demonstrate FastDraft by training two highly parameter efficient drafts for
the popular Phi-3-mini and Llama-3.1-8B models. Using FastDraft, we were able
to produce a draft model with approximately 10 billion tokens on a single
server with 8 Intel$^\circledR$ Gaudi$^\circledR$ 2 accelerators in under 24
hours. Our results show that the draft model achieves impressive results in key
metrics of acceptance rate, block efficiency and up to 3x memory bound speed up
when evaluated on code completion and up to 2x in summarization, text
completion and instruction tasks. We validate our theoretical findings through
benchmarking on the latest Intel$^\circledR$ Core$^{\tiny \text{TM}}$ Ultra,
achieving a wall-clock time speedup of up to 2x, indicating a significant
reduction in runtime. Due to its high quality, FastDraft unlocks large language
models inference on AI-PC and other edge-devices.

TL;DR: MuLan, a lightweight multilingual adapter, enhances cost-efficient and high-performance text-to-image generation across 110+ languages using pre-trained text encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve data efficiency and reduce costs in multilingual text-to-image generation by leveraging noisy Internet image-text pairs.

Method: Introduces MuLan, a <20M parameter adapter, trained with a frozen text encoder and image diffusion model, utilizing English data and multilingual text encoders.

Result: Achieves comparable performance in 110+ languages (CLIP similarity: 39.61 vs. 39.57 in English) and integrates with tools like LoRA and ControlNet.

Conclusion: MuLan offers a cost-effective, high-performance solution for multilingual T2I generation with broad applicability.

Abstract: In this work, we explore a cost-effective framework for multilingual image
generation. We find that, unlike models tuned on high-quality images with
multilingual annotations, leveraging text encoders pre-trained on widely
available, noisy Internet image-text pairs significantly enhances data
efficiency in text-to-image (T2I) generation across multiple languages.Based on
this insight, we introduce MuLan, Multi-Language adapter, a lightweight
language adapter with fewer than 20M parameters, trained alongside a frozen
text encoder and image diffusion model. Compared to previous multilingual T2I
models, this framework offers: (1) Cost efficiency. Using readily accessible
English data and off-the-shelf multilingual text encoders minimizes the
training cost; (2) High performance. Achieving comparable generation
capabilities in over 110 languages with CLIP similarity scores nearly matching
those in English (39.57 for English vs. 39.61 for other languages); and (3)
Broad applicability. Seamlessly integrating with compatible community tools
like LoRA, LCM, ControlNet, and IP-Adapter, expanding its potential use cases.

*Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Aaditya K. Singh, Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper situates few-shot in-context learning within a broader spectrum of meta-learned capabilities, suggesting it arises from any sequence distribution where context reduces prediction loss. It highlights generalization as key and connects to meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify diverse in-context learning abilities of language models (e.g., task adaptation, time series extrapolation) and explore their roots in linguistic dependencies.

Method: Proposes a perspective interpreting in-context learning as any context-driven loss reduction in sequence prediction, linking it to meta-learning.

Result: Identifies generalization as central, spanning novelty learning, flexibility in presentation, and application.

Conclusion: Advocates for broader research on in-context learning, encompassing diverse capabilities and generalization types.

Abstract: The ability of language models to learn a task from a few examples in context
has generated substantial interest. Here, we provide a perspective that
situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader
spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any
distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on
subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context
learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of
in-context abilities that language models exhibit -- such as adapting to tasks
from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective
also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level
processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel
structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of
generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not
only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning
from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss
broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned
agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by
suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader
spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JuRO, a Romanian legal MCQA dataset, CROL corpus, Law-RoG KG, and GRAF method for MCQA, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of resources and methods for legal MCQA in low-resource languages like Romanian.

Method: Introduces JuRO dataset, CROL corpus, Law-RoG KG, and proposes GRAF, a retrieval-augmented method for MCQA.

Result: GRAF achieves competitive or superior performance compared to SOTA methods in legal MCQA.

Conclusion: The work provides valuable resources and a novel method for legal MCQA in Romanian, advancing NLP in low-resource legal domains.

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have shown remarkable performances in
recent years, setting a new paradigm for NLP research and industry. The legal
domain has received some attention from the NLP community partly due to its
textual nature. Some tasks from this domain are represented by
question-answering (QA) tasks. This work explores the legal domain
Multiple-Choice QA (MCQA) for a low-resource language. The contribution of this
work is multi-fold. We first introduce JuRO, the first openly available
Romanian legal MCQA dataset, comprising three different examinations and a
number of 10,836 total questions. Along with this dataset, we introduce CROL,
an organized corpus of laws that has a total of 93 distinct documents with
their modifications from 763 time spans, that we leveraged in this work for
Information Retrieval (IR) techniques. Moreover, we are the first to propose
Law-RoG, a Knowledge Graph (KG) for the Romanian language, and this KG is
derived from the aforementioned corpus. Lastly, we propose a novel approach for
MCQA, Graph Retrieval Augmented by Facts (GRAF), which achieves competitive
results with generally accepted SOTA methods and even exceeds them in most
settings.

TL;DR: PRMs for LLM process supervision face challenges in data annotation and evaluation. MC estimation underperforms compared to LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation. BoN evaluation has biases. A consensus filtering mechanism improves performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in PRM development, especially data annotation and evaluation, to enhance process supervision in LLMs.

Method: Propose a consensus filtering mechanism integrating MC estimation with LLM-as-a-judge and a comprehensive evaluation framework.

Result: Improved model performance and data efficiency in BoN evaluation and step-wise error identification.

Conclusion: Developed a state-of-the-art PRM with practical guidelines for future research in process supervision.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) emerge as a promising approach for process
supervision in mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), which
aim to identify and mitigate intermediate errors in the reasoning processes.
However, the development of effective PRMs faces significant challenges,
particularly in data annotation and evaluation methodologies. In this paper,
through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that commonly used Monte Carlo
(MC) estimation-based data synthesis for PRMs typically yields inferior
performance and generalization compared to LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation
methods. MC estimation relies on completion models to evaluate current-step
correctness, leading to inaccurate step verification. Furthermore, we identify
potential biases in conventional Best-of-N (BoN) evaluation strategies for
PRMs: (1) The unreliable policy models generate responses with correct answers
but flawed processes, leading to a misalignment between the evaluation criteria
of BoN and the PRM objectives of process verification. (2) The tolerance of
PRMs of such responses leads to inflated BoN scores. (3) Existing PRMs have a
significant proportion of minimum scores concentrated on the final answer
steps, revealing the shift from process to outcome-based assessment in BoN
Optimized PRMs. To address these challenges, we develop a consensus filtering
mechanism that effectively integrates MC estimation with LLM-as-a-judge and
advocates a more comprehensive evaluation framework that combines
response-level and step-level metrics. Based on the mechanisms, we
significantly improve both model performance and data efficiency in the BoN
evaluation and the step-wise error identification task. Finally, we release a
new state-of-the-art PRM that outperforms existing open-source alternatives and
provides practical guidelines for future research in building process
supervision models.

TL;DR: LLMs often overestimate their confidence, risking critical decisions. Using distractor-augmented prompts improves calibration, with significant accuracy and ECE gains. Findings vary by model size and tuning, with persistent issues in person-based queries. Recommendations include fine-tuning, structured prompts, and model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overconfidence-misalignment in LLMs, which poses risks in critical applications, by analyzing calibration across models and datasets.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of nine LLMs and three QA datasets, comparing free-generation with distractor-augmented prompts.

Result: Distractors mitigate miscalibration (460% accuracy boost, 90% ECE reduction). RLHF-tuned models show calibration strengths but struggle on easy queries; smaller models benefit more but remain miscalibrated. Person-based queries are problematic.

Conclusion: Recommend targeted fine-tuning, structured prompting, and strategic model choice for reliable LLM deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable proficiency in natural language
tasks, yet their frequent overconfidence-misalignment between predicted
confidence and true correctness-poses significant risks in critical
decision-making applications. We present a comprehensive analysis on
calibration in LLMs across nine LLMs and three factual Question-Answering (QA)
datasets, systematically comparing standard free-generation settings against
structured distractor-augmented prompts. Our evaluation reveals that explicitly
incorporating distractors can substantially mitigate miscalibration, achieving
relative accuracy improvements up to 460% and ECE reductions up to 90%. Despite
general trends, we uncover nuanced findings: large RLHF-tuned models display
inherent calibration strengths but can paradoxically suffer increased
miscalibration on easier queries, whereas smaller models benefit
disproportionately from distractor prompts but remain significantly
miscalibrated. Through detailed analyses across question types, we identify
persistent calibration failures, particularly in person-based queries. We
conclude with concrete recommendations-targeted fine-tuning, structured
prompting, and strategic model choice-to ensure reliable, trustworthy LLM
deployments.

*Abdul Waheed, Hanin Atwany, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A label-free method for approximating ASR performance metrics (WER, CER) using multimodal embeddings and a proxy model, achieving high accuracy without ground truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labeled data and the high cost of labeling hinder the evaluation of ASR models' generalization. A label-free approach is needed.

Method: Uses multimodal embeddings for speech and text, a proxy model for metrics, and a regression model to predict WER/CER.

Result: Approximates metrics within a single-digit absolute difference, outperforming baselines by over 50%.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively estimates ASR performance without labels, enabling broader evaluation of models.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech foundation models are largely driven by scaling
both model size and data, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks,
including speech recognition. Traditionally, ASR models are evaluated using
metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER), which depend
on ground truth labels. As a result of limited labeled data from diverse
domains and testing conditions, the true generalization capabilities of these
models beyond standard benchmarks remain unclear. Moreover, labeling data is
both costly and time-consuming. To address this, we propose a novel label-free
approach for approximating ASR performance metrics, eliminating the need for
ground truth labels. Our method utilizes multimodal embeddings in a unified
space for speech and transcription representations, combined with a
high-quality proxy model to compute proxy metrics. These features are used to
train a regression model to predict key ASR metrics like Word Error Rate (WER)
and Character Error Rate (CER). We experiment with over 40 models across 14
datasets representing both standard and in-the-wild testing conditions. Our
results show that we approximate the metrics within a single-digit absolute
difference across all experimental configurations, outperforming the most
recent baseline by more than 50\%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates hallucination in ASR models, introduces HER as a metric, and shows its importance alongside WER for evaluating performance in high-stakes domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like WER fail to capture hallucination errors in ASR models, which are critical in high-stakes domains.

Method: Examines factors like distribution shifts, model size, and architecture, and introduces HER to quantify hallucinations. Analyzes over 20 ASR models.

Result: Key insights: WER can misrepresent hallucination rates, synthetic noise increases HER, and distribution shift strongly correlates with HER.

Conclusion: HER should complement WER for better ASR model evaluation, especially in critical applications.

Abstract: Speech foundation models trained at a massive scale, both in terms of model
and data size, result in robust systems capable of performing multiple speech
tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR). These models transcend
language and domain barriers, yet effectively measuring their performance
remains a challenge. Traditional metrics like word error rate (WER) and
character error rate (CER) are commonly used to evaluate ASR performance but
often fail to reflect transcription quality in critical contexts, particularly
when detecting fabricated outputs. This phenomenon, known as hallucination, is
especially concerning in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, legal, and
aviation, where errors can have severe consequences. In our work, we address
this gap by investigating hallucination in ASR models. We examine how factors
such as distribution shifts, model size, and model architecture influence the
hallucination error rate (HER), a metric we introduce to quantify
hallucinations. Our analysis of over 20 ASR models reveals \numinsights~key
insights: (1) High WERs can mask low hallucination rates, while low WERs may
conceal dangerous hallucinations. (2) Synthetic noise, both adversarial and
common perturbations like white noise, pitch shift, and time stretching,
increase HER. (3) Distribution shift correlates strongly with HER ($\alpha =
0.91$). Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating HER alongside
traditional metrics like WER to better assess ASR model performance,
particularly in high-stakes domains.

Motivation: To address the problem of people falling for too-good-to-be-true offers by leveraging AI to detect deception, inspired by human strategic deception in Diplomacy.

Method: Analyzes human deception in Diplomacy by extracting logical forms of agreements and computing rewards using agents' value functions, combined with text-based features.

Result: Achieves high precision in detecting human deception, outperforming a Large Language Model approach that mislabels true messages.

Conclusion: Proposes future human-AI tools can use these methods to trigger friction, allowing users to scrutinize suspicious proposals.

Abstract: An increasingly common socio-technical problem is people being taken in by
offers that sound ``too good to be true'', where persuasion and trust shape
decision-making. This paper investigates how \abr{ai} can help detect these
deceptive scenarios. We analyze how humans strategically deceive each other in
\textit{Diplomacy}, a board game that requires both natural language
communication and strategic reasoning. This requires extracting logical forms
of proposed agreements in player communications and computing the relative
rewards of the proposal using agents' value functions. Combined with text-based
features, this can improve our deception detection. Our method detects human
deception with a high precision when compared to a Large Language Model
approach that flags many true messages as deceptive. Future human-\abr{ai}
interaction tools can build on our methods for deception detection by
triggering \textit{friction} to give users a chance of interrogating suspicious
proposals.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the limits of token sequence compression into real-valued vectors, achieving ratios up to x1500, far beyond existing methods, and identifies cross-entropy loss as the key limiting factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on compute reduction rather than bit storage, with limited compression ratios (x10), despite the theoretical capacity of vectors being much higher.

Method: Replaces the encoder with a per-sample optimization procedure to explore higher compression ratios.

Result: Achieves compression ratios up to x1500, revealing a gap between theoretical capacity and practical use, with cross-entropy loss as the limiting factor.

Conclusion: Highlights significant optimization potential in model design by bridging the gap between theoretical and practical compression limits.

Abstract: A range of recent works addresses the problem of compression of sequence of
tokens into a shorter sequence of real-valued vectors to be used as inputs
instead of token embeddings or key-value cache. These approaches are focused on
reduction of the amount of compute in existing language models rather than
minimization of number of bits needed to store text. Despite relying on
powerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio
is typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in
theory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far
beyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size.
In this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder
with a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression
ratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between
existing and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show
that the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but
by the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on
this sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the
substantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their
practical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model
design.

Method: Examines data contamination impacts, reviews three contamination-free evaluation strategies (data updating, rewriting, prevention), and categorizes detection methods (white-box, gray-box, black-box).

Result: Highlights the need for dynamic benchmarks and LLM-driven evaluation methods to ensure reliable performance assessment.

Conclusion: Proposes stricter evaluation protocols and future directions to mitigate data contamination challenges in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress in various areas, such as text generation and code
synthesis. However, the reliability of performance evaluation has come under
scrutiny due to data contamination-the unintended overlap between training and
test datasets. This overlap has the potential to artificially inflate model
performance, as LLMs are typically trained on extensive datasets scraped from
publicly available sources. These datasets often inadvertently overlap with the
benchmarks used for evaluation, leading to an overestimation of the models'
true generalization capabilities. In this paper, we first examine the
definition and impacts of data contamination. Secondly, we review methods for
contamination-free evaluation, focusing on three strategies: data
updating-based methods, data rewriting-based methods, and prevention-based
methods. Specifically, we highlight dynamic benchmarks and LLM-driven
evaluation methods. Finally, we categorize contamination detecting methods
based on model information dependency: white-Box, gray-Box, and black-Box
detection approaches. Our survey highlights the requirements for more rigorous
evaluation protocols and proposes future directions for addressing data
contamination challenges.

### [126] [Towards Robust ESG Analysis Against Greenwashing Risks: Aspect-Action Analysis with Cross-Category Generalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15821)
*Keane Ong, Rui Mao, Deeksha Varshney, Erik Cambria, Gianmarco Mengaldo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces A3CG, a dataset for robust ESG analysis against greenwashing, linking sustainability aspects to actions for transparent evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLP methods for ESG analysis are vulnerable to greenwashing, often extracting misleading claims instead of objective performance.

Method: A3CG dataset links sustainability aspects with actions, enabling fine-grained, verifiable analysis and cross-category generalization.

Result: Experiments reveal limitations in current models, highlighting the need for improved robustness in ESG analysis.

Conclusion: A3CG advances ESG analysis by addressing greenwashing risks and promoting verifiable, transparent sustainability claims.

Abstract: Sustainability reports are key for evaluating companies' environmental,
social and governance, ESG performance, but their content is increasingly
obscured by greenwashing - sustainability claims that are misleading,
exaggerated, and fabricated. Yet, existing NLP approaches for ESG analysis lack
robustness against greenwashing risks, often extracting insights that reflect
misleading or exaggerated sustainability claims rather than objective ESG
performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce A3CG - Aspect-Action Analysis
with Cross-Category Generalization, as a novel dataset to improve the
robustness of ESG analysis amid the prevalence of greenwashing. By explicitly
linking sustainability aspects with their associated actions, A3CG facilitates
a more fine-grained and transparent evaluation of sustainability claims,
ensuring that insights are grounded in verifiable actions rather than vague or
misleading rhetoric. Additionally, A3CG emphasizes cross-category
generalization. This ensures robust model performance in aspect-action analysis
even when companies change their reports to selectively favor certain
sustainability areas. Through experiments on A3CG, we analyze state-of-the-art
supervised models and LLMs, uncovering their limitations and outlining key
directions for future research.

### [127] [SNaRe: Domain-aware Data Generation for Low-Resource Event Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17394)
*Tanmay Parekh, Yuxuan Dong, Lucas Bandarkar, Artin Kim, I-Hung Hsu, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SNaRe, a domain-aware synthetic data generation framework, improves event detection in specialized domains by addressing label noise and domain drift, outperforming baselines with significant F1 gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event detection in specialized domains suffers from label noise and domain drift when using existing data generation methods, limiting utility without expert annotations.

Method: SNaRe consists of Scout (extracts triggers), Narrator (generates domain-aligned sentences), and Refiner (ensures annotation quality) to mitigate domain drift and noise.

Result: SNaRe achieves 3-7% F1 gains in zero-shot/few-shot settings and 4-20% in multilingual generation, with improved annotation quality and reduced drift.

Conclusion: SNaRe effectively addresses domain-specific challenges in event detection, enhancing performance and annotation quality.

Abstract: Event Detection (ED) -- the task of identifying event mentions from natural
language text -- is critical for enabling reasoning in highly specialized
domains such as biomedicine, law, and epidemiology. Data generation has proven
to be effective in broadening its utility to wider applications without
requiring expensive expert annotations. However, when existing generation
approaches are applied to specialized domains, they struggle with label noise,
where annotations are incorrect, and domain drift, characterized by a
distributional mismatch between generated sentences and the target domain. To
address these issues, we introduce SNaRe, a domain-aware synthetic data
generation framework composed of three components: Scout, Narrator, and
Refiner. Scout extracts triggers from unlabeled target domain data and curates
a high-quality domain-specific trigger list using corpus-level statistics to
mitigate domain drift. Narrator, conditioned on these triggers, generates
high-quality domain-aligned sentences, and Refiner identifies additional event
mentions, ensuring high annotation quality. Experimentation on three diverse
domain ED datasets reveals how SNaRe outperforms the best baseline, achieving
average F1 gains of 3-7% in the zero-shot/few-shot settings and 4-20% F1
improvement for multilingual generation. Analyzing the generated trigger hit
rate and human evaluation substantiates SNaRe's stronger annotation quality and
reduced domain drift.

*Yu Yan, Sheng Sun, Zenghao Duan, Teli Liu, Min Liu, Zhiyi Yin, Jiangyu Lei, Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AVATAR, a novel attack framework using adversarial metaphors to jailbreak LLMs by calibrating benign content into harmful forms, achieving high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies overlook the difficulty of generating harmful content directly, focusing instead on inducing LLMs to transform benign content into harmful forms.

Method: AVATAR identifies benign metaphors as seeds, inducing LLMs to reason and calibrate them into harmful content or residuals.

Result: AVATAR effectively jailbreaks multiple advanced LLMs with a state-of-the-art attack success rate.

Conclusion: The study highlights the vulnerability of LLMs to metaphor-based jailbreaking and the effectiveness of AVATAR.

Abstract: Current studies have exposed the risk of Large Language Models (LLMs)
generating harmful content by jailbreak attacks. However, they overlook that
the direct generation of harmful content from scratch is more difficult than
inducing LLM to calibrate benign content into harmful forms. In our study, we
introduce a novel attack framework that exploits AdVersArial meTAphoR (AVATAR)
to induce the LLM to calibrate malicious metaphors for jailbreaking.
Specifically, to answer harmful queries, AVATAR adaptively identifies a set of
benign but logically related metaphors as the initial seed. Then, driven by
these metaphors, the target LLM is induced to reason and calibrate about the
metaphorical content, thus jailbroken by either directly outputting harmful
responses or calibrating residuals between metaphorical and professional
harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively
and transferable jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success
rate across multiple advanced LLMs.

*Moritz Altemeyer, Steffen Eger, Johannes Daxenberger, Yanran Chen, Tim Altendorf, Philipp Cimiano, Benjamin Schiller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating LLMs into Argument Summarization (ArgSum), proposing a prompt-based evaluation scheme and a new LLM-based system. It shows LLMs improve summary generation and evaluation, with Qwen-3-32B outperforming others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ArgSum by leveraging LLMs for both generation and evaluation, addressing limitations of prior methods.

Method: Proposes a prompt-based evaluation scheme and develops a new LLM-based ArgSum system, validated with a human benchmark dataset.

Result: LLMs significantly improve ArgSum, with Qwen-3-32B achieving top performance, surpassing GPT-4o and outperforming LLaMA-3.3-70B.

Conclusion: LLMs advance ArgSum, with smaller models like Qwen-3-32B showing superior performance, suggesting parameter count isn't the sole determinant of success.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various Natural Language
Generation (NLG) tasks, including Argument Summarization (ArgSum), a key
subfield of Argument Mining (AM). This paper investigates the integration of
state-of-the-art LLMs into ArgSum, including for its evaluation. In particular,
we propose a novel prompt-based evaluation scheme, and validate it through a
novel human benchmark dataset. Our work makes three main contributions: (i) the
integration of LLMs into existing ArgSum frameworks, (ii) the development of a
new LLM-based ArgSum system, benchmarked against prior methods, and (iii) the
introduction of an advanced LLM-based evaluation scheme. We demonstrate that
the use of LLMs substantially improves both the generation and evaluation of
argument summaries, achieving state-of-the-art results and advancing the field
of ArgSum. We also show that among the four LLMs integrated in (i) and (ii),
Qwen-3-32B, despite having the fewest parameters, performs best, even
surpassing GPT-4o, while LLaMA-3.3-70B consistently underperforms.

*Zhixun Chen, Ming Li, Yuxuan Huang, Yali Du, Meng Fang, Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ATLaS improves LLM agent tuning by focusing on critical steps in expert trajectories, reducing costs and enhancing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods clone full expert trajectories, introducing bias and weakening generalization. Critical steps like planning and reasoning are key to success.

Method: ATLaS identifies and finetunes LLMs on critical steps only, avoiding overfitting and reducing training costs.

Result: LLMs finetuned on 30% critical steps outperform those trained on full trajectories and other agents.

Conclusion: ATLaS enhances generalization and maintains base LLM skills, making it effective for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across multi-domain tasks. Existing agent tuning approaches
typically employ supervised finetuning on entire expert trajectories. However,
behavior-cloning of full trajectories can introduce expert bias and weaken
generalization to states not covered by the expert data. Additionally, critical
steps, such as planning, complex reasoning for intermediate subtasks, and
strategic decision-making, are essential to success in agent tasks, so learning
these steps is the key to improving LLM agents. For more effective and
efficient agent tuning, we propose ATLaS that identifies the critical steps in
expert trajectories and finetunes LLMs solely on these steps with reduced
costs. By steering the training's focus to a few critical steps, our method
mitigates the risk of overfitting entire trajectories and promotes
generalization across different environments and tasks. In extensive
experiments, an LLM finetuned on only 30% critical steps selected by ATLaS
outperforms the LLM finetuned on all steps and recent open-source LLM agents.
ATLaS maintains and improves base LLM skills as generalist agents interacting
with diverse environments.

### [131] [When Claims Evolve: Evaluating and Enhancing the Robustness of Embedding Models Against Misinformation Edits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03417)
*Jabez Magomere, Emanuele La Malfa, Manuel Tonneau, Ashkan Kazemi, Scott Hale*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness of sentence embedding models in claim-matching systems against edited claims, introduces a perturbation framework for evaluation, and proposes mitigation approaches to improve robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online misinformation evolves as users edit claims, but it's unclear if current embedding models used in retrieval are robust to such edits.

Method: A perturbation framework generates natural claim variations to evaluate embedding models in a multi-stage retrieval pipeline, testing mitigation approaches.

Result: Standard embedding models perform poorly on edited claims, while LLM-distilled models improve robustness at higher cost. Mitigation approaches enhance in-domain robustness by 17% and out-of-domain generalization by 10%.

Conclusion: The study provides practical improvements for claim-matching systems, enhancing fact-checking reliability for evolving misinformation.

Abstract: Online misinformation remains a critical challenge, and fact-checkers
increasingly rely on claim matching systems that use sentence embedding models
to retrieve relevant fact-checks. However, as users interact with claims
online, they often introduce edits, and it remains unclear whether current
embedding models used in retrieval are robust to such edits. To investigate
this, we introduce a perturbation framework that generates valid and natural
claim variations, enabling us to assess the robustness of a wide-range of
sentence embedding models in a multi-stage retrieval pipeline and evaluate the
effectiveness of various mitigation approaches. Our evaluation reveals that
standard embedding models exhibit notable performance drops on edited claims,
while LLM-distilled embedding models offer improved robustness at a higher
computational cost. Although a strong reranker helps to reduce the performance
drop, it cannot fully compensate for first-stage retrieval gaps. To address
these retrieval gaps, we evaluate train- and inference-time mitigation
approaches, demonstrating that they can improve in-domain robustness by up to
17 percentage points and boost out-of-domain generalization by 10 percentage
points. Overall, our findings provide practical improvements to claim-matching
systems, enabling more reliable fact-checking of evolving misinformation. Code

### [132] [Implicit Cross-Lingual Rewarding for Efficient Multilingual Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04647)
*Wen Yang, Junhong Wu, Chen Wang, Chengqing Zong, Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to transfer preference alignment from English to other languages using implicit rewards, reducing the need for multilingual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual preference alignment is hindered by data scarcity, despite progress in English LLMs.

Method: Derives an implicit reward model from English DPO-aligned models, annotates cross-lingual pairs, and fine-tunes for multilingual DPO.

Result: 12.72% average Win Rate improvement and 5.97% Length Control Win Rate increase across languages.

Conclusion: Leveraging English-aligned models enables efficient multilingual preference alignment, minimizing multilingual data requirements.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a prominent method for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While DPO has
enabled significant progress in aligning English LLMs, multilingual preference
alignment is hampered by data scarcity. To address this, we propose a novel
approach that $\textit{captures}$ learned preferences from well-aligned English
models by implicit rewards and $\textit{transfers}$ them to other languages
through iterative training. Specifically, we derive an implicit reward model
from the logits of an English DPO-aligned model and its corresponding reference
model. This reward model is then leveraged to annotate preference relations in
cross-lingual instruction-following pairs, using English instructions to
evaluate multilingual responses. The annotated data is subsequently used for
multilingual DPO fine-tuning, facilitating preference knowledge transfer from
English to other languages. Fine-tuning Llama3 for two iterations resulted in a
12.72% average improvement in Win Rate and a 5.97% increase in Length Control
Win Rate across all training languages on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard. Our
findings demonstrate that leveraging existing English-aligned models can enable
efficient and effective multilingual preference alignment, significantly
reducing the need for extensive multilingual preference data. The code is

Motivation: To address the lack of high-quality, manually annotated code-mixed datasets for Hindi-English, enabling robust NLP task evaluation.

Method: Creation of a dataset with 125K+ instances, annotated by three bilingual experts, covering diverse domains and scripts (Devanagari and Roman).

Result: Closed-source LLMs outperform traditional tools, and one-shot prompting enhances performance, especially in POS and NER tasks.

Conclusion: COMI-LINGUA provides a valuable resource for code-mixed NLP research, demonstrating the potential of prompt-based adaptation in low-resource settings.

Abstract: We introduce COMI-LINGUA, the largest manually annotated Hindi-English
code-mixed dataset, comprising 125K+ high-quality instances across five core
NLP tasks: Matrix Language Identification, Token-level Language Identification,
POS Tagging, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Machine Translation. Each
instance is annotated by three bilingual annotators, yielding over 376K expert
annotations with strong inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' Kappa $\geq$ 0.81).

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework (PWC, MT-Consistency, CARG) to evaluate and improve LLM response consistency in multi-turn interactions, enhancing stability without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need consistent behavior in high-stake domains, but current evaluations lack focus on multi-turn interaction stability.

Method: Develops PWC metric, MT-Consistency benchmark, and CARG framework integrating confidence scores for stable generation.

Result: CARG improves response stability without compromising accuracy, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for dependable LLM deployment in critical scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, but their deployment in high-stake domains requires consistent
and coherent behavior across multiple rounds of user interaction. This paper
introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving LLM response
consistency, making three key contributions. Code and data are available at:
https://github.com/yubol-bobo/MT-Consistency. First, we introduce
Position-Weighted Consistency (PWC), a metric designed to capture both the
importance of early-stage stability and recovery patterns in multi-turn
interactions. Second, we present MT-Consistency, a carefully curated benchmark
dataset spanning diverse domains and difficulty levels, specifically designed
to evaluate LLM consistency under various challenging follow-up scenarios.
Third, we introduce Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), a framework
that significantly improves response stability by explicitly integrating
internal model confidence scores during the generation process. Experimental
results demonstrate that CARG significantly improves response stability without
sacrificing accuracy, offering a practical path toward more dependable LLM
behavior in critical, real-world deployments.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' limitations in Low-Resource Language (LRL) translation, proposes knowledge distillation from large models, and improves performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance disparities in LRL translation due to limited resources and underrepresentation in datasets.

Method: Systematic evaluation of LLMs using FLORES-200 benchmark, exploration of alternative data sources, and knowledge distillation from large teacher models.

Result: Knowledge distillation improves EN->LB translation score from 0.36 to 0.89 for Llama-3.2-3B.

Conclusion: The study highlights effective strategies for enhancing LRL translation, emphasizing data scale and training efficiency.

Abstract: Low-Resource Languages (LRLs) present significant challenges in natural
language processing due to their limited linguistic resources and
underrepresentation in standard datasets. While recent advances in Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Neural Machine Translation have substantially
improved translation capabilities for high-resource languages, performance
disparities persist for LRLs, particularly impacting privacy-sensitive and
resource-constrained scenarios. This paper systematically evaluates current
LLMs in 200 languages using the FLORES-200 benchmark and demonstrates their
limitations in LRL translation capability. We also explore alternative data
sources, including news articles and bilingual dictionaries, and demonstrate
how knowledge distillation from large pre-trained teacher models can
significantly improve the performance of small LLMs on LRL translation tasks.
For example, this approach increases EN->LB with the LLM-as-a-Judge score on
the validation set from 0.36 to 0.89 for Llama-3.2-3B. Furthermore, we examine
different fine-tuning configurations, providing practical insights on optimal
data scale, training efficiency, and the preservation of generalization
capabilities of models under study.

TL;DR: DREAM enhances safety in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by disentangling risks and using supervised fine-tuning with RLAIF, improving safety without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs introduce unique safety challenges due to multimodal inputs, requiring new methods to disentangle and mitigate risks.

Method: Proposes DREAM, combining multimodal risk disentanglement, supervised fine-tuning, and iterative RLAIF to enhance safety alignment.

Result: DREAM improves safety by 16.17% in SIUO score over GPT-4V, without compromising normal task performance.

Conclusion: DREAM effectively addresses MLLM safety challenges, offering a robust solution for risk-aware multimodal models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pose unique safety challenges due to
their integration of visual and textual data, thereby introducing new
dimensions of potential attacks and complex risk combinations. In this paper,
we begin with a detailed analysis aimed at disentangling risks through
step-by-step reasoning within multimodal inputs. We find that systematic
multimodal risk disentanglement substantially enhances the risk awareness of
MLLMs. Via leveraging the strong discriminative abilities of multimodal risk
disentanglement, we further introduce \textbf{DREAM}
(\textit{\textbf{D}isentangling \textbf{R}isks to \textbf{E}nhance Safety
\textbf{A}lignment in \textbf{M}LLMs}), a novel approach that enhances safety
alignment in MLLMs through supervised fine-tuning and iterative Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). Experimental results show that DREAM
significantly boosts safety during both inference and training phases without
compromising performance on normal tasks (namely oversafety), achieving a
16.17\% improvement in the SIUO safe\&effective score compared to GPT-4V. The

*Di Wu, Yibin Lei, Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes calibrating hypothesis likelihoods in NMT to align decoding with real-world translation quality, improving performance even on top LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAP decoding in NMT often leads to low-quality translations due to misalignment with real-world quality.

Method: Calibrate hypothesis likelihoods by optimizing their Pearson correlation with translation quality.

Result: Substantial improvements in translation quality across metrics and human evaluations, even on specialized LLMs.

Conclusion: Calibration enhances MAP decoding efficiency and serves as a strong proxy for translation quality, outperforming some state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Neural machine translation (NMT) systems typically employ maximum a
posteriori (MAP) decoding to select the highest-scoring translation from the
distribution mass. However, recent evidence highlights the inadequacy of MAP
decoding, often resulting in low-quality or even pathological hypotheses -- the
decoding objective is not aligned with real-world translation quality. This
paper proposes calibrating hypothesis likelihoods with translation quality from
a distribution view by directly optimizing their Pearson correlation -- thereby
enhancing the effectiveness of translation decoding. With our method,
translation on large language models (LLMs) improves substantially after
limited training (2K instances per direction). This improvement is orthogonal
to those achieved through supervised fine-tuning, leading to substantial gains
across a broad range of metrics and human evaluations -- even when applied to
top-performing translation-specialized LLMs fine-tuned on high-quality
translation data, such as Tower, or when compared to recent preference
optimization methods, like CPO. Moreover, the calibrated translation likelihood
can directly serve as a strong proxy for translation quality, closely
approximating or even surpassing some state-of-the-art translation quality
estimation models, like CometKiwi. Lastly, our in-depth analysis demonstrates
that calibration enhances the effectiveness of MAP decoding, thereby enabling
greater efficiency in real-world deployment. The resulting state-of-the-art
translation model, which covers 10 languages, along with the accompanying code
and human evaluation data, has been released to the community:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study enhances Gemma2 LLM's Lithuanian fluency using pretraining and EWC, showing improved performance without forgetting prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the relationship between linguistic fluency and domain knowledge in continual learning with LLMs, focusing on under-represented languages like Lithuanian.

Method: Autoregressive pretraining on Lithuanian data (10% of CulturaX) with EWC to prevent forgetting, evaluated using perplexity and benchmark accuracy.

Result: EWC preserved and improved linguistic fluency and domain knowledge in both English and Lithuanian.

Conclusion: EWC enables efficient LLM adaptation to under-represented languages without original training data.

Abstract: In this technical report, we empirically investigate the relationship between
linguistic fluency and domain knowledge in the context of continual learning
with large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we enhance the linguistic
fluency of the Gemma2 LLM for the Lithuanian language by autoregressively
pretraining its full parameter set on the first 10\% of the Lithuanian language
component of the CulturaX dataset. To prevent catastrophic forgetting of the
model's existing domain knowledge, we apply Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC),
leveraging Fisher information estimated using data from the Massive Multitask
Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark. In the post-training evaluations, we
assess linguistic fluency through perplexity and evaluate domain knowledge
using accuracy on a suite of language understanding benchmarks, including
ARC-Easy, Belebele, GSM8K, HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, and Winogrande, in both
English and Lithuanian. The empirical results demonstrate that EWC not only
mitigates catastrophic forgetting by preserving the model's performance in
terms of both linguistic fluency and domain knowledge but also improves or
maintains these capabilities for the newly added Lithuanian language. These
findings highlight the potential for more efficient adaptation of
general-purpose LLMs to under-represented languages without requiring access to
the original training data. The accompanying codebase is openly accessible at

Method: Pre-training with enhanced data preprocessing, three-stage data mixing, and Multi-Token Prediction. Post-training uses a curated dataset of 130K problems, test-difficulty-driven rewards, and strategic resampling.

Result: MiMo-7B-Base shows exceptional reasoning potential, outperforming larger models. MiMo-7B-RL excels in mathematics, code, and general reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: MiMo-7B demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities through innovative training and reinforcement learning, setting a new benchmark for performance.

Abstract: We present MiMo-7B, a large language model born for reasoning tasks, with
optimization across both pre-training and post-training stages. During
pre-training, we enhance the data preprocessing pipeline and employ a
three-stage data mixing strategy to strengthen the base model's reasoning
potential. MiMo-7B-Base is pre-trained on 25 trillion tokens, with additional
Multi-Token Prediction objective for enhanced performance and accelerated
inference speed. During post-training, we curate a dataset of 130K verifiable
mathematics and programming problems for reinforcement learning, integrating a
test-difficulty-driven code-reward scheme to alleviate sparse-reward issues and
employing strategic data resampling to stabilize training. Extensive
evaluations show that MiMo-7B-Base possesses exceptional reasoning potential,
outperforming even much larger 32B models. The final RL-tuned model,
MiMo-7B-RL, achieves superior performance on mathematics, code and general
reasoning tasks, surpassing the performance of OpenAI o1-mini. The model
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/xiaomimimo/MiMo.

*Pratim Chowdhary, Peter Chin, Deepernab Chakrabarty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the $K$-MSHC method and Search-K-MSHC algorithm to identify minimal attention head sets for tasks in mid-sized language models, revealing task-specific circuits and shared computational patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which neural components drive specific capabilities in mid-sized language models (≤10B parameters).

Method: Introduces the $K$-MSHC methodology and Search-K-MSHC algorithm to identify minimal sets of attention heads crucial for tasks, applied to Gemma-9B for syntactic tasks.

Result: Task-specific head circuits were found: grammar tasks use early layers, word problems involve shallow and deep regions, and arithmetic verification is distributed. Non-linear circuit overlaps and dedicated 'super-heads' were discovered.

Conclusion: Syntactic and numerical competencies arise from specialized yet partially reusable head circuits, with minimal cross-task overlap for 'super-heads'.

Abstract: Understanding which neural components drive specific capabilities in
mid-sized language models ($\leq$10B parameters) remains a key challenge. We
introduce the $(\bm{K}, \epsilon)$-Minimum Sufficient Head Circuit ($K$-MSHC),
a methodology to identify minimal sets of attention heads crucial for
classification tasks as well as Search-K-MSHC, an efficient algorithm for
discovering these circuits. Applying our Search-K-MSHC algorithm to Gemma-9B,
we analyze three syntactic task families: grammar acceptability, arithmetic
verification, and arithmetic word problems. Our findings reveal distinct
task-specific head circuits, with grammar tasks predominantly utilizing early
layers, word problems showing pronounced activity in both shallow and deep
regions, and arithmetic verification demonstrating a more distributed pattern
across the network. We discover non-linear circuit overlap patterns, where
different task pairs share computational components at varying levels of
importance. While grammar and arithmetic share many "weak" heads, arithmetic
and word problems share more consistently critical "strong" heads. Importantly,
we find that each task maintains dedicated "super-heads" with minimal
cross-task overlap, suggesting that syntactic and numerical competencies emerge
from specialized yet partially reusable head circuits.

*Prashanth Vijayaraghavan, Soroush Vosoughi, Lamogha Chiazor, Raya Horesh, Rogerio Abreu de Paula, Ehsan Degan, Vandana Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DECASTE, a framework to detect caste biases in LLMs, revealing systemic biases against marginalized groups like Dalits and Shudras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored issue of caste-based biases in LLMs, particularly affecting marginalized groups in India.

Method: Proposes DECASTE, a multi-dimensional framework evaluating caste fairness across socio-cultural, economic, educational, and political dimensions using customized prompts.

Result: LLMs systematically reinforce caste biases, with notable disparities between oppressed and dominant caste groups.

Conclusion: Highlights pervasive caste biases in LLMs and calls for more inclusive bias evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing (NLP) and expanded their applications across
diverse domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have been
shown to reflect and perpetuate harmful societal biases, including those based
on ethnicity, gender, and religion. A critical and underexplored issue is the
reinforcement of caste-based biases, particularly towards India's marginalized
caste groups such as Dalits and Shudras. In this paper, we address this gap by
proposing DECASTE, a novel, multi-dimensional framework designed to detect and
assess both implicit and explicit caste biases in LLMs. Our approach evaluates
caste fairness across four dimensions: socio-cultural, economic, educational,
and political, using a range of customized prompting strategies. By
benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that these models
systematically reinforce caste biases, with significant disparities observed in
the treatment of oppressed versus dominant caste groups. For example, bias
scores are notably elevated when comparing Dalits and Shudras with dominant
caste groups, reflecting societal prejudices that persist in model outputs.
These results expose the subtle yet pervasive caste biases in LLMs and
emphasize the need for more comprehensive and inclusive bias evaluation
methodologies that assess the potential risks of deploying such models in
real-world contexts.

### [143] [Distilling the Implicit Multi-Branch Structure in LLMs' Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16142)
*Shicheng Xu, Liang Pang, Yunchang Zhu, Jia Gu, Zihao Wei, Jingcheng Deng, Feiyang Pan, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLKD, a reinforcement learning-based distillation framework, improves reasoning in smaller LLMs by aligning student models with the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure, outperforming standard SFT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) fails to capture the implicit multi-branch reasoning structure of teacher models, limiting effective knowledge transfer.

Method: Proposes RLKD, using a Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM) to compute rewards for structural alignment and reinforcement learning to distill reasoning paths.

Result: RLKD outperforms SFT-RL pipelines, even with minimal data, enhancing student reasoning beyond fixed output paths.

Conclusion: RLKD effectively distills complex reasoning structures, unlocking greater potential in smaller LLMs.

Abstract: Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reasoning paths generated by
teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying
authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that
authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning
(which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving
(which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an
implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich
structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning
path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To
address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based
distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model
(GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving
steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and
teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to
internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than
merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard
SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime,
unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation.

### [144] [When can isotropy help adapt LLMs' next word prediction to numerical domains?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17135)
*Rashed Shelim, Shengzhe Xu, Walid Saad, Naren Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how pre-trained LLMs can be adapted for numerical tasks by analyzing isotropy in embedding spaces, addressing hallucination issues and ensuring performance guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate in numerical domains, risking reliability in critical applications. Theoretical understanding of their adaptation to numeric tasks is lacking.

Method: A log-linear model with softmax in LLMs' output layer is used. The study focuses on isotropy in embeddings to resolve shift-invariance and ensure performance.

Result: Isotropy in LLM embeddings preserves representation structure, solving shift-invariance and guaranteeing performance. Experimental results vary with data and model traits.

Conclusion: Isotropy analysis bridges the gap in adapting LLMs to numerical tasks, offering reliability and performance guarantees.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that vector representations of contextual
embeddings learned by pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are effective in
various downstream tasks in numerical domains. Despite their significant
benefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe
consequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare,
retail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability
and accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black-box and
provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there is little
theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help solve
numeric downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding
when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical
domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the
contextual embedding space. Specifically, we consider a log-linear model for
LLMs in which numeric data can be predicted from its context through a network
with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in
self-attention). We demonstrate that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art
performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM
embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of
the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in
pre-trained models, we show how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in
contextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of
representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a
performance guarantee. Experiments show that different characteristics of
numeric data and model architecture could have different impacts on isotropy.

TL;DR: WiNGPT-3.0, a 32B-parameter LLM, improves medical reasoning via multi-stage training (SFT + RL) and achieves strong scores (66.6 on MedCalc, 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE), showing RL's efficacy with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of LLMs in medical reasoning (structured, interpretable, verifiable) and deployment challenges (computational resources, data privacy).

Method: Multi-stage training pipeline (general, medical, clinical reasoning) with SFT, RL, curated CoT datasets, reward models, and diagnostic simulations.

Result: Scores of 66.6 (MedCalc) and 87.1 (MedQA-USMLE); clinical reasoning improved from 58.1 to 62.5.

Conclusion: RL with limited data enhances medical reasoning, enabling more trustworthy and deployable LLMs in healthcare.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant limitations, notably
in structured, interpretable, and verifiable medical reasoning, alongside
practical deployment challenges related to computational resources and data
privacy. This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion
parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for
medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within
healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically
applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline
tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline
incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL),
leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward
models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0
demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of
66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training
improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1
to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied
with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical
reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited
data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically
deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information
infrastructures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaGen Blended RAG improves RAG performance for domain-specific enterprise datasets without fine-tuning, using metadata generation and hybrid query indexes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG struggles with domain-specific datasets due to semantic variability and lack of generalization, making fine-tuning impractical.

Method: Introduces a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes (dense and sparse vectors) to enhance semantic retrievers.

Result: Achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy on PubMedQA, outperforming zero-shot benchmarks and rivaling fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: MetaGen Blended RAG offers a scalable, robust solution for enterprise search, excelling in specialized domains without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with domain-specific
enterprise datasets, often isolated behind firewalls and rich in complex,
specialized terminology unseen by LLMs during pre-training. Semantic
variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's
context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack
generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with
retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce
'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances
semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query
indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and
acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted
hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On
the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval
accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks
and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on
datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a
new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization
across specialized domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The impact of diversity in example selection for in-context learning is underexplored, despite its potential benefits.

Method: Systematic experiments across tasks (sentiment classification, math, code) using models like Llama-3.1, Gemma-2, and Mistral-v0.3, and a theoretical framework.

Result: Diversity-aware selection methods improve performance, particularly on complex tasks, and enhance robustness.

Conclusion: Incorporating diversity in example selection benefits in-context learning, supported by empirical and theoretical evidence.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a crucial capability of current large language
models (LLMs), where the selection of examples plays a key role in performance.
While most existing approaches focus on selecting the most similar examples to
the query, the impact of diversity in example selection remains underexplored.
We systematically investigate the role of diversity in in-context example
selection through experiments across a range of tasks, from sentiment
classification to more challenging math and code problems. Experiments on
Llama-3.1, Gemma-2, and Mistral-v0.3 families of models show that
diversity-aware selection methods improve performance, particularly on complex
tasks like math and code, and enhance robustness to out-of-distribution
queries. To support these findings, we introduce a theoretical framework that
explains the benefits of incorporating diversity in in-context example
selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fin-Force, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in forward counterfactual reasoning for financial markets, aiming to automate risk and opportunity anticipation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forward counterfactual reasoning is crucial for financial markets but is cognitively demanding, necessitating automated solutions. LLMs, though promising, are unexplored for this purpose.

Method: The authors create Fin-Force, a benchmark using financial news headlines to evaluate LLMs in generating forward counterfactuals.

Result: Experiments on Fin-Force assess state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual methods, highlighting limitations and future research directions.

Conclusion: Fin-Force enables scalable, automated forward counterfactual reasoning for financial markets, offering structured insights for decision-making.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning typically involves considering alternatives to
actual events. While often applied to understand past events, a distinct
form-forward counterfactual reasoning-focuses on anticipating plausible future
developments. This type of reasoning is invaluable in dynamic financial
markets, where anticipating market developments can powerfully unveil potential
risks and opportunities for stakeholders, guiding their decision-making.
However, performing this at scale is challenging due to the cognitive demands
involved, underscoring the need for automated solutions. Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer promise, but remain unexplored for this application. To address
this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark, Fin-Force-FINancial FORward
Counterfactual Evaluation. By curating financial news headlines and providing
structured evaluation, Fin-Force supports LLM based forward counterfactual
generation. This paves the way for scalable and automated solutions for
exploring and anticipating future market developments, thereby providing
structured insights for decision-making. Through experiments on Fin-Force, we
evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual generation methods, analyzing
their limitations and proposing insights for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmniCharacter is a speech-language personality interaction model for immersive Role-Playing Agents (RPAs), addressing the gap in voice traits and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RPAs lack voice traits, limiting immersive experiences. OmniCharacter aims to integrate speech and language for richer interactions.

Method: OmniCharacter combines role-specific personality and vocal traits, using a dataset (OmniCharacter-10K) with diverse characters and dynamic speech responses.

Result: The model outperforms existing RPAs and speech-language models in content and style, with a latency of 289ms.

Conclusion: OmniCharacter advances RPAs by integrating speech and language, offering immersive, low-latency interactions.

Abstract: Role-Playing Agents (RPAs), benefiting from large language models, is an
emerging interactive AI system that simulates roles or characters with diverse
personalities. However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues
among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice
style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to
be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we
propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction
model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter
enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and
vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and
language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we
construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive
characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic
speech response (135K). Experimental results showcase that our method yields
better responses in terms of both content and style compared to existing RPAs
and mainstream speech-language models, with a response latency as low as 289ms.

Motivation: To improve protein-text models by addressing data leakage in benchmarks and inadequate NLP metrics.

Method: Reorganizes datasets, introduces a biological entity-based evaluation framework, and proposes a retrieval-enhanced method.

Result: The retrieval-enhanced method outperforms fine-tuned LLMs in protein-to-text generation, with accuracy and efficiency in training-free scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and method enhance protein-text model performance and evaluation.

Abstract: In recent years, protein-text models have gained significant attention for
their potential in protein generation and understanding. Current approaches
focus on integrating protein-related knowledge into large language models
through continued pretraining and multi-modal alignment, enabling simultaneous
comprehension of textual descriptions and protein sequences. Through a thorough
analysis of existing model architectures and text-based protein understanding
benchmarks, we identify significant data leakage issues present in current
benchmarks. Moreover, conventional metrics derived from natural language
processing fail to accurately assess the model's performance in this domain. To
address these limitations, we reorganize existing datasets and introduce a
novel evaluation framework based on biological entities. Motivated by our
observation, we propose a retrieval-enhanced method, which significantly
outperforms fine-tuned LLMs for protein-to-text generation and shows accuracy
and efficiency in training-free scenarios. Our code and data can be seen at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can learn unseen, low-resource languages for speech recognition without supervised data.

Method: Experiments on four endangered languages using in-context learning (ICL), comparing probability-based and instruction-based approaches.

Result: More relevant text samples improve performance; probability-based ICL outperforms instruction-based. LLMs match/surpass dedicated ASR models.

Conclusion: ICL enables LLMs to learn new languages effectively for ASR, preserving their original capabilities.

Abstract: With approximately 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, current large language
models (LLMs) support only a small subset. Prior research indicates LLMs can
learn new languages for certain tasks without supervised data. We extend this
investigation to speech recognition, investigating whether LLMs can learn
unseen, low-resource languages through in-context learning (ICL). With
experiments on four diverse endangered languages that LLMs have not been
trained on, we find that providing more relevant text samples enhances
performance in both language modelling and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
tasks. Furthermore, we show that the probability-based approach outperforms the
traditional instruction-based approach in language learning. Lastly, we show
ICL enables LLMs to achieve ASR performance that is comparable to or even
surpasses dedicated language models trained specifically for these languages,
while preserving the original capabilities of the LLMs.

Conclusion: CHIMERA provides a scalable way to study and predict recombination in science, with practical applications for hypothesis generation.

Abstract: A hallmark of human innovation is the process of recombination -- creating
original ideas by integrating elements of existing mechanisms and concepts. In
this work, we automatically mine the scientific literature and build CHIMERA: a
large-scale knowledge base (KB) of recombination examples. CHIMERA can be used
to empirically explore at scale how scientists recombine concepts and take
inspiration from different areas, or to train supervised machine learning
models that learn to predict new creative cross-domain directions. To build
this KB, we present a novel information extraction task of extracting
recombination from scientific paper abstracts, collect a high-quality corpus of
hundreds of manually annotated abstracts, and use it to train an LLM-based
extraction model. The model is applied to a large corpus of papers in the AI
domain, yielding a KB of over 28K recombination examples. We analyze CHIMERA to
explore the properties of recombination in different subareas of AI. Finally,

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Group Attention (DGA) to reduce computational inefficiencies in Transformer-based LLMs by optimizing attention sparsity through a group coding strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational inefficiencies in long-context modeling due to redundant attention computations in Transformer-based LLMs.

Method: Reformulates sequence modeling as a supervised task, analyzes attention sparsity, and proposes DGA using group coding to aggregate less important tokens.

Result: DGA significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: DGA offers an efficient solution for attention optimization in LLMs, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language
processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational
inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while
attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal}
computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional
probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task},
enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a
clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we
theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens
significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate
attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group
coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness
against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we
propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group
coding to explicitly reduce redundancy by aggregating less important tokens
during attention computation. Empirical results show that our DGA significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.Code is

*Xuchen Ma, Jianxiang Yu, Wenming Shao, Bo Pang, Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C$^2$TU is a training-free, prompt-free method for unveiling Chinese cloaked toxic content, outperforming competitors by up to 71% in F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of toxic content on social media, especially disguised toxicity in Chinese, lacks effective solutions, prompting the need for C$^2$TU.

Method: Uses substring matching with Chinese homo-graph and toxic lexicon, then filters non-toxic candidates using BERT or LLMs, correcting cloaks to toxicities.

Result: Achieves superior performance, outperforming competitors by up to 71% in F1 score and 35% in accuracy on Chinese toxic datasets.

Conclusion: C$^2$TU effectively addresses the challenge of Chinese cloaked toxicity, offering a robust solution with high performance.

Abstract: Social media platforms have experienced a significant rise in toxic content,
including abusive language and discriminatory remarks, presenting growing
challenges for content moderation. Some users evade censorship by deliberately
disguising toxic words through homophonic cloak, which necessitates the task of
unveiling cloaked toxicity. Existing methods are mostly designed for English
texts, while Chinese cloaked toxicity unveiling has not been solved yet. To
tackle the issue, we propose C$^2$TU, a novel training-free and prompt-free
method for Chinese cloaked toxic content unveiling. It first employs substring
matching to identify candidate toxic words based on Chinese homo-graph and
toxic lexicon. Then it filters those candidates that are non-toxic and corrects
cloaks to be their corresponding toxicities. Specifically, we develop two model
variants for filtering, which are based on BERT and LLMs, respectively. For
LLMs, we address the auto-regressive limitation in computing word occurrence
probability and utilize the full semantic contexts of a text sequence to reveal
cloaked toxic words. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C$^2$TU can achieve
superior performance on two Chinese toxic datasets. In particular, our method
outperforms the best competitor by up to 71% on the F1 score and 35% on
accuracy, respectively. Our code and data are available at

Result: NSM correlates strongly with ground-truth ratings and performs well in classification tasks.

Conclusion: Text alone in image-caption datasets can effectively estimate imageability and concreteness using NSM.

Abstract: Imageability (potential of text to evoke a mental image) and concreteness
(perceptibility of text) are two psycholinguistic properties that link visual
and semantic spaces. It is little surprise that computational methods that
estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as
collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we
work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers
sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in
particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic
embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then
propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood
Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive
experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings
than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these
properties for classification. Our code and data are available on GitHub
(https://github.com/Artificial-Memory-Lab/imageability).

*Zhitao He, Sandeep Polisetty, Zhiyuan Fan, Yuchen Huang, Shujin Wu, Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMBoundary improves multimodal reasoning in MLLMs by calibrating confidence at each reasoning step, reducing errors and enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of multimodal reasoning in MLLMs, particularly the lack of step-wise confidence assessment leading to hallucination.

Method: Proposes MMBoundary, using textual and cross-modal self-rewarding signals for step-wise confidence estimation, followed by reinforcement learning for alignment.

Result: Achieves 7.5% reduction in calibration errors and up to 8.3% task performance improvement.

Conclusion: MMBoundary effectively enhances MLLM reasoning by step-wise confidence calibration and self-correction.

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal
reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and
multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior
work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for
training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning
step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we
present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary
awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve
this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal
self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM
reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of
self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression
warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward
functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at
each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical
results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across
diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in
multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive jailbreaking strategies for LLMs, categorizing them by comprehension levels and achieving a 98.9% success rate on GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of adversarial attacks on LLMs that bypass safety constraints by exploiting comprehension weaknesses.

Method: Proposes a framework classifying LLMs into Type I and Type II based on semantic understanding, with tailored jailbreaking strategies for each.

Result: Experiments show the adaptive strategy significantly improves jailbreaking success, notably 98.9% on GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The adaptive approach effectively exploits LLM vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for improved defenses.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) via jailbreaking
techniques-methods that circumvent their built-in safety and ethical
constraints-have emerged as a critical challenge in AI security. These attacks
compromise the reliability of LLMs by exploiting inherent weaknesses in their
comprehension capabilities. This paper investigates the efficacy of
jailbreaking strategies that are specifically adapted to the diverse levels of
understanding exhibited by different LLMs. We propose the Adaptive Jailbreaking
Strategies Based on the Semantic Understanding Capabilities of Large Language
Models, a novel framework that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II
categories according to their semantic comprehension abilities. For each
category, we design tailored jailbreaking strategies aimed at leveraging their
vulnerabilities to facilitate successful attacks. Extensive experiments
conducted on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our adaptive strategy markedly
improves the success rate of jailbreaking. Notably, our approach achieves an
exceptional 98.9% success rate in jailbreaking GPT-4o(29 May 2025 release)

*Bangde Du, Ziyi Ye, Zhijing Wu, Jankowska Monika, Shuqi Zhu, Qingyao Ai, Yujia Zhou, Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ValueSim is a framework that simulates individualized human value systems in LLMs by generating personal backstories, improving alignment accuracy by over 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with individualized human values, not just broad ethics, is a gap in current methods.

Method: ValueSim uses personal backstories and a multi-module architecture inspired by the Cognitive-Affective Personality System.

Result: Achieves over 10% higher top-1 accuracy than retrieval-augmented methods, with performance improving as more user history is available.

Conclusion: ValueSim effectively simulates individual values, enhancing LLM alignment with human values.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit increasingly human-like
capabilities, aligning them with human values has become critically important.
Contemporary advanced techniques, such as prompt learning and reinforcement
learning, are being deployed to better align LLMs with human values. However,
while these approaches address broad ethical considerations and helpfulness,
they rarely focus on simulating individualized human value systems. To address
this gap, we present ValueSim, a framework that simulates individual values
through the generation of personal backstories reflecting past experiences and
demographic information. ValueSim converts structured individual data into
narrative backstories and employs a multi-module architecture inspired by the
Cognitive-Affective Personality System to simulate individual values based on
these narratives. Testing ValueSim on a self-constructed benchmark derived from
the World Values Survey demonstrates an improvement in top-1 accuracy by over
10% compared to retrieval-augmented generation methods. Further analysis
reveals that performance enhances as additional user interaction history
becomes available, indicating the model's ability to refine its persona
simulation capabilities over time.

### [159] [Aligned but Blind: Alignment Increases Implicit Bias by Reducing Awareness of Race](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00253)
*Lihao Sun, Chengzhi Mao, Valentin Hofmann, Xuechunzi Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Aligned language models (LMs) show implicit bias despite explicit evaluations suggesting fairness. Alignment amplifies bias by ignoring racial concepts early in processing, leading to unintended stereotypes. A new mitigation strategy encourages racial concept representation in early layers, effectively reducing bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why value-aligned LMs exhibit implicit bias despite appearing unbiased in explicit evaluations, and to develop a method to mitigate such bias.

Method: Analyze the mechanisms behind bias in aligned LMs, focusing on early internal representations. Propose a bias mitigation strategy that incentivizes racial concept representation in early model layers.

Result: Alignment amplifies implicit bias by overlooking racial concepts in ambiguous contexts. The proposed mitigation strategy effectively reduces bias by making the model more aware of racial nuances.

Conclusion: Ignoring racial concepts in early model layers can perpetuate subtle biases. Proactively representing these concepts mitigates bias, offering a more effective solution than traditional unlearning methods.

Abstract: Although value-aligned language models (LMs) appear unbiased in explicit bias
evaluations, they often exhibit stereotypes in implicit word association tasks,
raising concerns about their fair usage. We investigate the mechanisms behind
this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias
in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their
unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal
representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely
fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by
this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by
incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers.
In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our
interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts
effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans,
ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs.

TL;DR: Analysis of 40,000 tweets from Ukraine conflict (Feb-May 2022) reveals propaganda vs. trusted accounts use distinct strategies, with NLP and HITL methods identifying emotional disinformation vs. factual reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of social media in shaping public perception during the Ukraine conflict and identify strategies used in information warfare.

Method: Used NLP and machine learning on 40,000 tweets (Feb-May 2022) with HITL analysis to assess sentiment, themes, and narratives.

Result: Propaganda accounts used emotional disinformation, while trusted accounts focused on facts. Clustering suggested coordinated efforts.

Conclusion: The study highlights information warfare dynamics and offers methods for future social media influence research in conflicts.

Abstract: The conflict in Ukraine has been not only characterised by military
engagement but also by a significant information war, with social media
platforms like X, formerly known as Twitter playing an important role in
shaping public perception. This article provides an analysis of tweets from
propaganda accounts and trusted accounts collected from the onset of the war,
February 2022 until the middle of May 2022 with n=40,000 total tweets. We
utilise natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to assess
the sentiment and identify key themes, topics and narratives across the dataset
with human-in-the-loop (HITL) analysis throughout. Our findings indicate
distinct strategies in how information is created, spread, and targeted at
different audiences by both sides. Propaganda accounts frequently employ
emotionally charged language and disinformation to evoke fear and distrust,
whereas other accounts, primarily Western tend to focus on factual reporting
and humanitarian aspects of the conflict. Clustering analysis reveals groups of
accounts with similar behaviours, which we suspect indicates the presence of
coordinated efforts. This research attempts to contribute to our understanding
of the dynamics of information warfare and offers techniques for future studies
on social media influence in military conflicts.

TL;DR: EvaLearn is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' learning capability and efficiency through sequential problem-solving, revealing varied model performance and highlighting gaps in current evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored aspect of LLMs' learning potential and efficiency in challenging tasks, providing a novel evaluation perspective.

Method: EvaLearn uses 648 problems across six task types, grouped into 182 sequences, requiring sequential problem-solving. Five automated metrics evaluate learning capability and efficiency. Nine models are benchmarked under different learning settings.

Result: Models show varied performance; some exhibit strong learning ability, while others struggle or show negative transfer. Static ability doesn't guarantee learning advantage.

Conclusion: EvaLearn offers a new dimension for evaluating LLMs, highlighting gaps in current assessments and promoting dynamic evaluation approaches.

Abstract: We introduce EvaLearn, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) on their learning capability and efficiency in
challenging tasks, a critical, yet underexplored aspect of model potential.
EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into
182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most
existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models
to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained
from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics
to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We
extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance
profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial
performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to
benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we
investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that
instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model
learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static
abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all
tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model
performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for
assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human
capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation
approaches. All datasets, the automatic evaluation framework, and the results
studied in this paper are available at the GitHub repository.

*Masaki Sakata, Benjamin Heinzerling, Sho Yokoi, Takumi Ito, Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how language models (LMs) internally represent named entities, using clustering metrics to evaluate entity mention identification and distinction. Results show effective performance (0.66-0.9 precision/recall) and reveal compact, low-dimensional entity representations in early layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LMs internally identify and distinguish named entity mentions, addressing ambiguity and variability in entity-mention relationships.

Method: Proposes a clustering-based framework to analyze LM representations, evaluating how mentions of the same entity cluster and different entities separate. Tests five Transformer-based autoregressive models.

Result: LMs effectively identify and distinguish entities (metrics 0.66-0.9). Entity information is compactly represented in early layers and influences word prediction.

Conclusion: LMs internally organize entity information in a way that mirrors real-world knowledge structures, providing insights into their representation and use of entities.

Abstract: We analyze the extent to which internal representations of language models
(LMs) identify and distinguish mentions of named entities, focusing on the
many-to-many correspondence between entities and their mentions. We first
formulate two problems of entity mentions -- ambiguity and variability -- and
propose a framework analogous to clustering quality metrics. Specifically, we
quantify through cluster analysis of LM internal representations the extent to
which mentions of the same entity cluster together and mentions of different
entities remain separated. Our experiments examine five Transformer-based
autoregressive models, showing that they effectively identify and distinguish
entities with metrics analogous to precision and recall ranging from 0.66 to
0.9. Further analysis reveals that entity-related information is compactly
represented in a low-dimensional linear subspace at early LM layers.
Additionally, we clarify how the characteristics of entity representations
influence word prediction performance. These findings are interpreted through
the lens of isomorphism between LM representations and entity-centric knowledge
structures in the real world, providing insights into how LMs internally
organize and use entity information.

*Yubo Wang, Ping Nie, Kai Zou, Lijun Wu, Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: One-shot Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) efficiently unlocks LLMs' reasoning potential, outperforming RL with 20x less compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL is expensive and unstable for improving LLMs' reasoning. A cheaper, stable alternative is needed.

Method: CFT uses diverse model-generated solutions and teacher LLM critiques on one problem for fine-tuning.

Result: Qwen-Math-7B-CFT improves 15% on math and 16% on logic tasks with just 5 GPU hours.

Conclusion: One-shot CFT is a simple, general, and efficient method to enhance LLM reasoning.

Abstract: We have witnessed that strong LLMs like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 possess
immense reasoning potential inherited from the pre-training stage. With
reinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash
these models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but
also unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a
critical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning
potential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that
Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the
reasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting
diverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to
provide detailed critiques. We fine-tune Qwen and Llama family models, ranging
from 1.5B to 14B parameters, on the CFT data and observe significant
performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks. For example, with just 5 GPU
hours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT show an average improvement of 15% on six
math benchmarks and 16% on three logic reasoning benchmarks. These results are
comparable to or even surpass the results from RL with 20x less compute.
Ablation studies reveal the robustness of one-shot CFT across different prompt
problems. These results highlight one-shot CFT as a simple, general, and
compute-efficient approach to unleashing the reasoning capabilities of modern
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates knowledge editing (KE) methods in the medical domain, proposing MedEditBench for assessment and introducing SGR-Edit for improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration of KE methods in the complex medical domain and their limitations in generalization.

Method: Introduces MedEditBench, a benchmark with three editing paradigms, and SGR-Edit, which uses model-derived rationales for editing.

Result: Current KE methods show superficial memorization; SGR-Edit outperforms them by improving generalization.

Conclusion: SGR-Edit offers better medical knowledge editing, with insights for practical applications.

Abstract: Recently, knowledge editing (KE) has emerged as a promising approach to
update specific facts in Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for full
retraining. Despite the effectiveness in general-domain benchmarks, their
applicability to complex medical domain remains largely unexplored. Medical
knowledge editing is particularly challenging, as it requires LLMs to
internalize the knowledge and generalize to unseen scenarios for effective and
interpretable decision-making. In this work, we propose a novel framework
called MedEditBench to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of existing KE
methods in the medical domain. In MedEditBench, we introduce a new medical
knowledge editing benchmark as well as three different knowledge editing
paradigms, which are designed to assess the impact of different knowledge
sources for editing. Our findings indicate that current KE methods result in
only superficial memorization of the injected information, failing to
generalize to new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we present
Self-Generated Rationale Editing (SGR-Edit), which utilizes model-derived
rationales as the target knowledge for editing, thereby uncovering the
underlying reasoning process and demonstrating significant improvements over
existing KE approaches. Additionally, we offer deeper insights into medical
knowledge editing, including the localization of medical knowledge in LLMs and
the impact of sequential editing on evolving knowledge. This could provide
practical guidance for implementing KE methods in real-world medical
applications.

### [165] [An Efficient Task-Oriented Dialogue Policy: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning Injected by Elite Individuals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03519)
*Yangyang Zhao, Ben Niu, Libo Qin, Shihan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes combining Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to balance exploration and exploitation in task-oriented dialogue systems, introducing an elite individual injection (EII) mechanism to enhance efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL struggles with balancing exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional state and action spaces, often leading to poor convergence or local optima. EAs offer global search capabilities, but their direct integration with DRL is hindered by natural language flexibility.

Method: The approach integrates EA's global search with DRL's local optimization and introduces an EII mechanism to improve EA's efficiency by injecting top-performing individuals.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show improved balance between exploration and exploitation, enhanced performance, and reduced exploration time due to the EII mechanism.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines EA and DRL for task-oriented dialogue policy, achieving better performance and efficiency through the EII mechanism.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely used in task-oriented dialogue
systems to optimize dialogue policy, but it struggles to balance exploration
and exploitation due to the high dimensionality of state and action spaces.
This challenge often results in local optima or poor convergence. Evolutionary
Algorithms (EAs) have been proven to effectively explore the solution space of
neural networks by maintaining population diversity. Inspired by this, we
innovatively combine the global search capabilities of EA with the local
optimization of DRL to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation.
Nevertheless, the inherent flexibility of natural language in dialogue tasks
complicates this direct integration, leading to prolonged evolutionary times.
Thus, we further propose an elite individual injection mechanism to enhance
EA's search efficiency by adaptively introducing best-performing individuals
into the population. Experiments across four datasets show that our approach
significantly improves the balance between exploration and exploitation,
boosting performance. Moreover, the effectiveness of the EII mechanism in
reducing exploration time has been demonstrated, achieving an efficient
integration of EA and DRL on task-oriented dialogue policy tasks.

TL;DR: Seed-Coder introduces a scalable, model-centric approach to code pretraining data for LLMs, reducing human effort and achieving top performance in code-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for code pretraining data rely heavily on human effort, limiting scalability and introducing biases. Seed-Coder aims to minimize human involvement while improving performance.

Method: Seed-Coder uses a model-centric pipeline for scoring and filtering code data, with supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, and LongCoT reinforcement learning for reasoning models.

Result: Seed-Coder outperforms similar-sized open-source models and some larger ones in code generation, completion, editing, reasoning, and software engineering tasks.

Conclusion: Seed-Coder demonstrates that minimizing human involvement in data construction can yield superior performance in code-related tasks for LLMs.

Abstract: Code data in large language model (LLM) pretraining is recognized crucial not
only for code-related tasks but also for enhancing general intelligence of
LLMs. Current open-source LLMs often heavily rely on human effort to produce
their code pretraining data, such as employing hand-crafted filtering rules
tailored to individual programming languages, or using human-annotated data to
train quality filters. However, these approaches are inherently limited in
scalability, prone to subjective biases, and costly to extend and maintain
across diverse programming languages. To address these challenges, we introduce
Seed-Coder, a series of open-source LLMs comprising base, instruct and
reasoning models of 8B size, minimizing human involvement in data construction.
Our code pretraining data is produced by a model-centric data pipeline, which
predominantly leverages LLMs for scoring and filtering code data. The instruct
model is further trained via supervised fine-tuning and preference
optimization, and the reasoning model leverages Long-Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT)
reinforcement learning to improve multi-step code reasoning. Seed-Coder
achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models of similar size and
even surpasses some much larger models, demonstrating superior performance in
code generation, code completion, code editing, code reasoning, and software
engineering tasks.

TL;DR: Knockout Assessment improves LLM-as-a-Judge accuracy by using iterative pairwise comparisons in a knockout tournament system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-Judge methods lack a global ranking perspective due to reliance on individual or single-round pairwise assessments.

Method: Proposes Knockout Assessment, a tournament-based iterative pairwise comparison method for LLM evaluations.

Result: Improves scoring accuracy, increasing Pearson correlation with expert evaluations by 0.07 on average.

Conclusion: Knockout Assessment aligns LLM assessments more closely with human scoring.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be effective evaluators across
various domains such as machine translations or the scientific domain. Current
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches rely mostly on individual assessments or a single
round of pairwise assessments, preventing the judge LLM from developing a
global ranking perspective. To address this, we present Knockout Assessment, an
LLM-asa Judge method using a knockout tournament system with iterative pairwise
comparisons. Experiments across three LLMs on two datasets show that knockout
assessment improves scoring accuracy, increasing Pearson correlation with
expert evaluations by 0.07 on average for university-level exam scoring and
machine translation evaluations, aligning LLM assessments more closely with
human scoring.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Magic Mushroom, a benchmark for evaluating RAG systems under diverse retrieval noise conditions, highlighting their sensitivity and room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to replicate real-world retrieval noise, limiting reliable robustness assessment of RAG systems.

Method: Defines four categories of retrieval noise and introduces Magic Mushroom, a benchmark with 7,468 single-hop and 3,925 multi-hop QA pairs, allowing flexible noise configuration.

Result: LLMs and RAG denoising strategies show significant sensitivity to noise distributions and require improvement.

Conclusion: Magic Mushroom is a valuable tool for advancing noise-robust RAG systems, aiding their real-world deployment.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models
(LLMs) by incorporating external retrieved information, mitigating issues such
as hallucination and outdated knowledge. However, RAG systems are highly
sensitive to retrieval noise prevalent in real-world scenarios. Existing
benchmarks fail to emulate the complex and heterogeneous noise distributions
encountered in real-world retrieval environments, undermining reliable
robustness assessment. In this paper, we define four categories of retrieval
noise based on linguistic properties and noise characteristics, aiming to
reflect the heterogeneity of noise in real-world scenarios. Building on this,
we introduce Magic Mushroom, a benchmark for replicating "magic mushroom"
noise: contexts that appear relevant on the surface but covertly mislead RAG
systems. Magic Mushroom comprises 7,468 single-hop and 3,925 multi-hop
question-answer pairs. More importantly, Magic Mushroom enables researchers to
flexibly configure combinations of retrieval noise according to specific
research objectives or application scenarios, allowing for highly controlled
evaluation setups. We evaluate LLM generators of varying parameter scales and
classic RAG denoising strategies under diverse noise distributions to
investigate their performance dynamics during progressive noise encroachment.
Our analysis reveals that both generators and denoising strategies have
significant room for improvement and exhibit extreme sensitivity to noise
distributions. Magic Mushroom emerges as a promising tool for evaluating and
advancing noise-robust RAG systems, accelerating their widespread deployment in
real-world applications. The Magic Mushroom benchmark is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing KV cache misalignment in sparse decoding methods, which degrades generation quality due to error accumulation.

Method: Proposes Rectified Sparse Attention (ReSA), integrating block-sparse attention with periodic dense rectification to refresh the KV cache.

Result: Achieves near-lossless quality with 2.42× speedup at 256K sequence length, validated across math, language, and retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: ReSA is a practical solution for efficient, scalable long-context inference.

Abstract: Efficient long-sequence generation is a critical challenge for Large Language
Models. While recent sparse decoding methods improve efficiency, they suffer
from KV cache misalignment, where approximation errors accumulate and degrade
generation quality. In this work, we propose Rectified Sparse Attention (ReSA),
a simple yet effective method that combines block-sparse attention with
periodic dense rectification. By refreshing the KV cache at fixed intervals
using a dense forward pass, ReSA bounds error accumulation and preserves
alignment with the pretraining distribution. Experiments across math reasoning,
language modeling, and retrieval tasks demonstrate that ReSA achieves
near-lossless generation quality with significantly improved efficiency.
Notably, ReSA delivers up to 2.42$\times$ end-to-end speedup under decoding at
256K sequence length, making it a practical solution for scalable long-context
inference. Code is available at https://aka.ms/ReSA-LM.

*Alan Mitkiy, James Smith, Hana Satou, Hiroshi Tanaka, Emily Johnson, F Monkey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DES introduces a dynamic perturbation budget for adversarial training, improving robustness and accuracy by adapting to instance-specific characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods use fixed perturbation budgets, ignoring instance-specific robustness. DES aims to address this limitation.

Method: DES dynamically adjusts the perturbation budget using gradient-based boundary distance, softmax entropy confidence, and Monte Carlo dropout uncertainty.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show DES outperforms fixed-budget and prior adaptive methods in robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: DES offers a data-driven, instance-aware approach to adversarial training, with theoretical support for stability and convergence.

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

*Yi Lu, Jiawang Cao, Yongliang Wu, Bozheng Li, Licheng Tang, Yangguang Ji, Chong Wu, Jay Wu, Wenbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSVP bridges the gap between reasoning and visual perception in MLLMs by integrating reasoning-driven localization and segmentation refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation, creating a disconnect between reasoning and perception.

Method: RSVP uses a two-stage framework: reasoning-driven localization with visual prompts and segmentation refinement via VLSM.

Result: RSVP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW.

Conclusion: RSVP effectively integrates cognitive reasoning with structured visual understanding, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

*Zhaoyang Lv, Maurizio Monge, Ka Chen, Yufeng Zhu, Michael Goesele, Jakob Engel, Zhao Dong, Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in photorealistic scene reconstruction using egocentric devices, proposing VIBA for precise calibration and a Gaussian Splatting-based image formation model to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook details like rolling-shutter effects and dynamic ranges, leading to inaccurate reconstructions. This study aims to enhance accuracy by addressing these issues.

Method: The study uses visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) for precise timestamp calibration and integrates a physical image formation model into Gaussian Splatting to account for sensor characteristics.

Result: Experiments show a consistent +1 dB PSNR improvement with VIBA and an additional +1 dB with the proposed image formation model.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly improve photorealistic reconstruction accuracy, validated on Project Aria and Meta Quest3 devices.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMRB, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on multi-image reasoning tasks, highlighting gaps in existing benchmarks and showing open-source MLLMs lag behind commercial ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM benchmarks lack evaluation of reasoning over multiple images, leaving this capability underexplored.

Method: MMRB includes 92 sub-tasks for spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning, with GPT-4o and human-annotated solutions. A sentence-level matching framework is proposed for evaluation.

Result: Open-source MLLMs perform poorly compared to commercial ones, and reward models struggle with multi-image ranking tasks.

Conclusion: MMRB fills a critical gap in evaluating multi-image reasoning, revealing significant limitations in current MLLMs and reward models.

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

*Heng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs), a plug-and-play module for single-image super-resolution (SISR), reducing parameters and computation by over 60% while improving performance, especially at higher upscaling factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SISR methods rely on indirect enhancements like specialized loss functions. LSKs aim to directly improve image frequency components for better efficiency and performance.

Method: Proposes LSKs, rank-one matrices decomposed into orthogonal one-dimensional kernels, to enhance frequency components. Includes interpretable analysis of feature maps.

Result: LSKs reduce parameters and computation by over 60% and improve model performance, particularly with higher upscaling factors.

Conclusion: LSKs offer an efficient, effective solution for SISR, combining reduced computational load with enhanced performance.

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image
super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as
specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable
Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to
directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs
are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline
methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in
both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is
achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable
one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of
the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability
of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of
parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.
Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit
superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

*Maksym Ivashechkin, Oscar Mendez, Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised pipeline for 3D human generation addresses challenges like realism, diversity, and control by combining image diffusion models, transformer-based mapping, and point-cloud diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling 3D human generation from text prompts is challenging due to issues like fine detail, realism, and lack of diverse data.

Method: The pipeline involves generating photorealistic human images with controllable attributes, mapping image features to 3D point clouds using transformers, and training a point-cloud diffusion model.

Result: Achieves faster 3D human generation with improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.

Conclusion: The approach advances 3D human generation by addressing key limitations and will release code and dataset.

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications
in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such
as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or
Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text
prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail,
accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over
appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data
also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human
model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these
challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset
with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a
state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping
approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based
architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion
model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the
original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human
generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with
significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.
We will make the code and dataset available.

*Shenshen Li, Kaiyuan Deng, Lei Wang, Hao Yang, Chong Peng, Peng Yan, Fumin Shen, Heng Tao Shen, Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the need for large datasets in MLLMs by proposing RAP, a method to identify high-value 'cognitive samples' for efficient multi-modal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce data redundancy and computational costs in MLLMs by focusing on sparse, high-impact training samples.

Method: Introduces RAP with two estimators (CDE and ACE) and a Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM) to select and enhance cognitive samples.

Result: Achieves superior performance with only 9.3% of training data, reducing computational costs by over 43%.

Conclusion: Smaller, high-value datasets can outperform full corpora in multi-modal reasoning, validated by RAP's success.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ReXVQA is the largest benchmark for VQA in chest radiology, evaluating AI models like MedGemma, which outperforms human radiologists in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI in radiological reasoning, bridging the gap between AI and clinical expertise.

Method: Introduces a diverse task suite reflecting radiological skills, evaluates eight multimodal models, and conducts a human reader study.

Result: MedGemma achieves 83.24% accuracy, surpassing human radiologists (77.27%), with distinct performance patterns between AI and humans.

Conclusion: ReXVQA sets a new standard for radiological AI evaluation, enabling next-generation systems with expert-level reasoning.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

TL;DR: Gen-n-Val is a novel framework using LLMs and VLLMs to generate high-quality synthetic data for computer vision tasks, reducing invalid data and improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like data scarcity, label noise, and poor synthetic data quality in tasks like object detection and instance segmentation.

Method: Leverages Layer Diffusion, LLMs, and VLLMs for generating single-object masks and diverse backgrounds, with two agents: a prompt optimizer and a data validator.

Result: Reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7% and improves mAP by 1% on rare classes in COCO, with significant gains in open-vocabulary detection.

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val effectively enhances synthetic data quality and boosts performance in instance segmentation and object detection tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Motivation: Underwater images suffer from degradation due to physical constraints; the paper aims to enhance them while preserving details and adhering to physical models.

Method: Combines Jaffe-McGlamery physical model with capsule clustering for feature learning, estimating transmission maps and background light in parallel streams.

Result: Achieves +0.5dB PSNR improvement over best methods with lower computational cost, or +1dB PSNR with similar budgets.

Conclusion: The physics-guided dual-stream approach effectively enhances underwater images, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

*Delong Chen, Willy Chung, Yejin Bang, Ziwei Ji, Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WorldPrediction, a video-based benchmark to evaluate AI models' world modeling and procedural planning capabilities, highlighting their current limitations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents lack clear methods for learning world models and procedural planning, unlike humans. Current benchmarks focus on low-level tasks, missing higher-level abstractions.

Method: WorldPrediction uses discriminative tasks (WorldPrediction-WM and WorldPrediction-PP) with visual observations and action equivalents to prevent low-level cue exploitation. It is grounded in a formal semi-MDP framework.

Result: Current AI models achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP, while humans perform perfectly.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals significant gaps in AI's world modeling and planning abilities, urging further research to bridge this divide.

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry
out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world
model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models,
especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out
procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a
video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning
capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus
primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,
WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal
and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to
distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered
sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual
distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different
types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across
different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual
observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity
cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions
observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is
grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring
better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human
filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models
barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP
whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLUCC introduces a context-driven method for puck detection in hockey videos, leveraging player behavior cues, outperforming prior methods by 12.2% in precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Puck detection is challenging due to its small size, occlusions, and motion blur. Players' body and gaze cues provide strong contextual hints.

Method: PLUCC combines a contextual encoder (player orientations), feature pyramid encoder (multiscale features), and gating decoder (channel gating).

Result: PLUCC achieves 12.2% higher average precision and 25% better RSLE than baselines.

Conclusion: Contextual understanding significantly improves puck detection, benefiting automated sports analysis.

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2\% and RSLE average precision of 25\%. Our research demonstrates the
critical role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection
performance, with broad implications for automated sports analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes STVP, a novel method for precise viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming, combining saliency and trajectory data for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Volumetric video is emerging as a key technology for VR/AR/MR, but viewport prediction remains understudied, necessitating better methods for optimal performance.

Method: STVP uses Uniform Random Sampling (URS) for efficiency, a saliency detection technique for spatial-temporal analysis, and fuses saliency with trajectory data for prediction.

Result: Experiments show STVP outperforms existing methods in accuracy for volumetric video streaming.

Conclusion: STVP is a pioneering solution for viewport prediction in volumetric video, with potential to enhance VR/AR/MR experiences.

Abstract: Volumetric video, also known as hologram video, is a novel medium that
portrays natural content in Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and
Mixed Reality (MR). It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a
prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that
each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as
the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal
performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the
end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and
Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of
viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively
utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge,
this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric
video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform
Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still
preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency
detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for
detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we
intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate
viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the
effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using
state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the
superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and
source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study fine-tunes video transformer models (VideoMAE, ViViT, TimeSformer) on Bangla Sign Language datasets (BdSLW60, BdSLW401) for sign language recognition, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community in Bangladesh by automating the recognition of Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) gestures.

Method: Fine-tuning state-of-the-art video transformer architectures on BdSL datasets, applying data augmentation, and using 10-fold stratified cross-validation for evaluation.

Result: VideoMAE achieved the highest accuracies (95.5% on BdSLW60, 81.04% on BdSLW401), outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: Video transformers show strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition, with performance influenced by dataset size, quality, and model architecture.

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and
classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text
or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In
Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of
communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study
fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT,
and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset
with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in
9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were
also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401
sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,
including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve
model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model
selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,
while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data
from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models
significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning
approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video

*Weijian Luo, Colin Zhang, Debing Zhang, Zhengyang Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-Instruct* (DI*) is a data-efficient post-training method for one-step text-to-image models, improving human preferences without image data. It uses online RLHF with a novel score-based divergence regularization, outperforming larger models in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance human preferences in one-step text-to-image models efficiently, avoiding reliance on image data and improving stability and performance.

Method: Frames alignment as online RLHF with a novel score-based divergence regularization. Derives a tractable loss function for optimization.

Result: DI*-SDXL-1step (2.6B model) outperforms a 50-step 12B model in benchmarks (ImageReward, PickScore, CLIP) with 1.88% inference time.

Conclusion: Proper post-training enables small one-step models to surpass larger multi-step models, contributing to human-centric ML.

Abstract: We propose Diff-Instruct* (DI*), a data-efficient post-training approach for
one-step text-to-image generative models to improve its human preferences
without requiring image data. Our method frames alignment as online
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which optimizes the one-step
model to maximize human reward functions while being regularized to be kept
close to a reference diffusion process. Unlike traditional RLHF approaches,
which rely on the Kullback-Leibler divergence as the regularization, we
introduce a novel general score-based divergence regularization that
substantially improves performance as well as post-training stability. Although
the general score-based RLHF objective is intractable to optimize, we derive a
strictly equivalent tractable loss function in theory that can efficiently
compute its \emph{gradient} for optimizations. We introduce
\emph{DI*-SDXL-1step}, which is a 2.6B one-step text-to-image model at a
resolution of $1024\times 1024$, post-trained from DMD2 w.r.t SDXL. \textbf{Our
2.6B \emph{DI*-SDXL-1step} model outperforms the 50-step 12B FLUX-dev model} in
ImageReward, PickScore, and CLIP score on the Parti prompts benchmark while
using only 1.88\% of the inference time. This result clearly shows that with
proper post-training, the small one-step model is capable of beating huge
multi-step diffusion models. Our model is open-sourced at this link:

contribute to human-centric machine learning techniques.

*Matthew W. Shinkle, Mark D. Lescroart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Activation maximization in DNN-based encoding models predicts and modulates human brain responses to visual stimuli, revealing selective features in the visual cortex.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited insight into specific features driving brain responses in DNN-based encoding models and explore visual selectivity.

Method: Uses activation maximization on a pretrained Inception V3 network, linear regression for fMRI prediction, and generates images optimized for cortical voxel responses.

Result: Generated images reliably drive activity in targeted brain regions, matching known selectivity and validating the method's efficacy.

Conclusion: Activation maximization successfully extends to DNN-based encoding models, enabling flexible characterization and modulation of human visual system responses.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDA improves LMMs' recognition of novel concepts by generating targeted synthetic data using contrastive features, outperforming SOTA methods by up to 12.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs struggle with novel concepts due to pre-trained knowledge limitations and domain-specific gaps, leading to misrecognition of visually similar or rare concepts.

Method: CoDA extracts contrastive textual and visual features, uses multimodal generative models for synthetic data, and filters results for quality.

Result: CoDA achieves significant accuracy gains: 12.3% (NovelSpecies), 5.1% (SUN), and 6.0% (iNat) over SOTA methods.

Conclusion: CoDA effectively enhances LMMs' ability to recognize and reason about novel or rare concepts through targeted data augmentation.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often struggle to recognize novel concepts, as
they rely on pre-trained knowledge and have limited ability to capture subtle
visual details. Domain-specific knowledge gaps in training also make them prone
to confusing visually similar, commonly misrepresented, or low-resource
concepts. To help LMMs better align nuanced visual features with language,
improving their ability to recognize and reason about novel or rare concepts,
we propose a Contrastive visual Data Augmentation (CoDA) strategy. CoDA
extracts key contrastive textual and visual features of target concepts against
the known concepts they are misrecognized as, and then uses multimodal
generative models to produce targeted synthetic data. Automatic filtering of
extracted features and augmented images is implemented to guarantee their
quality, as verified by human annotators. We show the effectiveness and
efficiency of CoDA on low-resource concept and diverse scene recognition
datasets including INaturalist and SUN. We additionally collect NovelSpecies, a
benchmark dataset consisting of newly discovered animal species that are
guaranteed to be unseen by LMMs. LLaVA-1.6 1-shot updating results on these
three datasets show CoDA significantly improves SOTA visual data augmentation
strategies by 12.3% (NovelSpecies), 5.1% (SUN), and 6.0% (iNat) absolute gains
in accuracy.

### [187] [Is Perturbation-Based Image Protection Disruptive to Image Editing?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04394)
*Qiuyu Tang, Bonor Ayambem, Mooi Choo Chuah, Aparna Bharati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Perturbation-based image protection methods fail to fully prevent diffusion-based editing, sometimes improving edits instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of perturbation-based methods in protecting images from misuse by diffusion models like Stable Diffusion.

Method: Experiments with various perturbation methods across domains (natural scenes, artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image, style editing).

Result: Protection often fails, with edits adhering to prompts; noise may enhance text-image association.

Conclusion: Perturbation-based methods are insufficient for robust protection against diffusion-based editing.

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation
and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks
associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding
imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A
fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing
attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the
reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image
protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks)
and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover
that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios,
diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image
which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that
adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given
text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences
such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods
may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against
diffusion-based editing.

*Jeong Hun Yeo, Hyeongseop Rha, Se Jin Park, Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient multimodal speech LLM framework for AVSR, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs in LLM-based AVSR systems due to high temporal resolution processing.

Method: Early AV-fusion, audio-visual speech Q-Former, and refined query allocation with speech rate predictor.

Result: Achieves 0.72% WER on LRS3, uses 3.5 tokens/sec, reduces tokens by 86%, and cuts FLOPs by 35.7%.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently balances performance and computational cost in AVSR.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) achieves robust speech recognition in
noisy environments by combining auditory and visual information. However,
recent Large Language Model (LLM) based AVSR systems incur high computational
costs due to the high temporal resolution of audio-visual speech processed by
LLMs. In this work, we introduce an efficient multimodal speech LLM framework
that minimizes token length while preserving essential linguistic content. Our
approach employs an early AV-fusion module for streamlined feature integration,
an audio-visual speech Q-Former that dynamically allocates tokens based on
input duration, and a refined query allocation strategy with a speech rate
predictor to adjust token allocation according to speaking speed of each audio
sample. Extensive experiments on the LRS3 dataset show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with a WER of 0.72% while using only 3.5 tokens
per second. Moreover, our approach not only reduces token usage by 86% compared
to the previous multimodal speech LLM framework, but also improves
computational efficiency by reducing FLOPs by 35.7%.

### [189] [Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04401)
*Gustavo Perez, Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes filter normalization for deep learning filters to address distortion in atmospheric transfer, improving performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical filters are normalized for consistency, but deep learning filters lack such constraints, leading to distorted responses under atmospheric transfer.

Method: Introduces filter normalization with learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization, to ensure atmosphere-equivariant filters.

Result: Significant improvements on benchmarks; ResNet34 outperforms CLIP. Normalization enhances robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: Filter normalization regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves performance, bridging classical and deep learning principles.

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are
carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid
artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional
filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although
they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in
the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,
their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address
this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable
scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective
modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling
co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep
learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and
convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant
improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our
ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals
that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization
regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and
generalization.

*Hermann Kumbong, Xian Liu, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ming-Yu Liu, Xihui Liu, Ziwei Liu, Daniel Y. Fu, Christopher Ré, David W. Romero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMAR improves image generation by addressing VAR's limitations with next-scale prediction and masked generation, achieving better quality, faster speeds, and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR's parallel token generation and superlinear sequence scaling reduce image quality and efficiency. HMAR aims to overcome these issues.

Method: HMAR uses next-scale prediction as a Markovian process and masked generation for controllable token subsets, with efficient block-sparse attention kernels.

Result: HMAR outperforms VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive models on ImageNet benchmarks, with faster training/inference and lower memory use.

Conclusion: HMAR offers superior performance, flexibility, and efficiency, enabling zero-shot image editing and adaptable sampling schedules.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

*Patrik Mesec, Alan Jović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes face defrontalization to improve pose-invariant face recognition, outperforming frontalization methods on larger datasets but not on small ones like Multi-PIE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose-invariant face recognition methods rely on impractical face frontalization and are often evaluated on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The method involves training a face defrontalization model (FFWM) on aligned frontal-profile pairs, then using it to augment training data for a ResNet-50 model with ArcFace loss.

Result: Defrontalization improves performance on larger datasets (LFW, AgeDB, CFP) but not on Multi-PIE for extreme poses, suggesting overfitting in current methods.

Conclusion: Face defrontalization is a viable alternative to frontalization, especially for larger datasets, but current methods may overfit small datasets.

Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a
face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which
is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,
current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization
and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these
methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically
evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we
propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face
defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction
model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference
step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization
FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed
using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial
feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly
defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with
our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared
with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and
Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without
defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over
the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger
open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses
(75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current
methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

TL;DR: xRIR is a framework for cross-room Room Impulse Response (RIR) prediction, combining geometric and acoustic features to generalize across environments, validated on a new dataset and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving realistic spatial acoustics in mixed reality requires generalizable RIR estimation, which existing methods lack due to their single-environment focus.

Method: xRIR combines a geometric feature extractor (from panorama depth images) and a RIR encoder (from few reference samples) for cross-room prediction.

Result: Outperforms baselines on the ACOUSTICROOMS dataset (300,000+ RIRs) and shows successful sim-to-real transfer in four real-world environments.

Conclusion: xRIR demonstrates strong generalizability and realism, advancing spatial acoustic modeling for mixed reality.

Abstract: In mixed reality applications, a realistic acoustic experience in spatial
environments is as crucial as the visual experience for achieving true
immersion. Despite recent advances in neural approaches for Room Impulse
Response (RIR) estimation, most existing methods are limited to the single
environment on which they are trained, lacking the ability to generalize to new
rooms with different geometries and surface materials. We aim to develop a
unified model capable of reconstructing the spatial acoustic experience of any
environment with minimum additional measurements. To this end, we present xRIR,
a framework for cross-room RIR prediction. The core of our generalizable
approach lies in combining a geometric feature extractor, which captures
spatial context from panorama depth images, with a RIR encoder that extracts
detailed acoustic features from only a few reference RIR samples. To evaluate
our method, we introduce ACOUSTICROOMS, a new dataset featuring high-fidelity
simulation of over 300,000 RIRs from 260 rooms. Experiments show that our
method strongly outperforms a series of baselines. Furthermore, we successfully
perform sim-to-real transfer by evaluating our model on four real-world
environments, demonstrating the generalizability of our approach and the
realism of our dataset.

TL;DR: FALO is a hardware-friendly LiDAR 3D detection method that achieves SOTA accuracy and fast inference on edge devices by using 1D sequences and ConvDotMix blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR 3D detection methods are inefficient for edge devices due to irregular memory access and high computational costs.

Method: FALO arranges sparse 3D voxels into a 1D sequence and processes it with ConvDotMix blocks (large-kernel convolutions, Hadamard products, linear layers) and implicit grouping.

Result: FALO achieves competitive performance on benchmarks (nuScenes, Waymo) and is 1.6~9.8x faster than SOTA on mobile GPUs/NPUs.

Conclusion: FALO is efficient for resource-constrained platforms and suitable for deployment on embedded devices.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse
convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on
resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and
high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly
approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D
point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a
1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then
processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel
convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides
sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and
introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.
Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit
grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and
takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are
friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily
deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D
detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves
competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest
SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit
(NPU).

TL;DR: AuthGuard improves deepfake detection by combining vision-language contrastive learning and uncertainty learning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods fail to generalize to unseen forgeries due to reliance on statistical artifacts tied to specific generation processes.

Method: Train a vision encoder using image-text contrastive learning with text from MLLMs, integrating data uncertainty learning for robustness. Interface with an LLM for interpretability.

Result: AuthGuard achieves AUC gains of 6.15% (DFDC) and 16.68% (DF40), and improves reasoning by 24.69% (DDVQA).

Conclusion: AuthGuard enhances generalization and interpretability in deepfake detection, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the
ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their
reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied
to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from
new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose
that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection
generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as
recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside
statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder
by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive
learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot
prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,
commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from
pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data
uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating
noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly
interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable
deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework,
AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15%
on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard
significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on
the DDVQA dataset.

*Gustavo Henrique do Nascimento, Ian Pons, Anna Helena Reali Costa, Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for pruning both neurons and layers in deep learning models simultaneously, improving computational efficiency and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in pruning methods by enabling simultaneous pruning of neurons and layers, which current strategies do not support.

Method: Proposes selecting the best pruned subnetwork (from layer or neuron pruning) based on representation similarity to the parent model using Centered Kernel Alignment.

Result: Achieves high FLOPs reduction (86.37% and 95.82% for ResNet56 and ResNet110) with minimal accuracy drop, robustness to adversarial samples, and reduced carbon emissions (83.31%).

Conclusion: The method advances pruning techniques, offering a balanced approach to model efficiency and performance, contributing to GreenAI.

Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks.
However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and
computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and
resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning
structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves
computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing
neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,
simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill
this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,
we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model
as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer
pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose
by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent
(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel
Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse
models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive
experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the
effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point
Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas
our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on
the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%
FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial
and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI,
reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a
new chapter in pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of low-quality images and high energy consumption in smart terminal devices for real-time road crack detection.

Method: Uses SRCNN for image enhancement, SCU for power-efficient image processing, and GAT for multi-scale feature fusion.

Result: Achieves 98.6% accuracy on CrackVision12K and reduces power consumption by 33% (5.6 mJ).

Conclusion: EECD-Net offers a scalable, low-power solution for real-time infrastructure monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the
instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and
transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution
imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring
performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage
detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and
energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated
Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address
the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image
resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike
Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is
proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly
reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)
module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations
through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range
dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing
detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the
CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\%
detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as
Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains
exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial
33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a
transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a
scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure
monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: RACRO enhances multi-modal reasoning by optimizing visual captioning for downstream tasks, avoiding costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending slow-thinking LLMs to multi-modal tasks is challenging due to vision-language alignment costs.

Method: Proposes RACRO, a reinforcement learning strategy aligning visual captioning with reasoning objectives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, improving scalability and adaptability.

Conclusion: RACRO effectively bridges perception and reasoning without costly multi-modal retraining.

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks
by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such
capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging
due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading
the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple
perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language
representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only
reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual
extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and
informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,
we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward
Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that
aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By
closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO
significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized
representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show
that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance
while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more
advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal
re-alignment.

*Biao Guo, Fangmin Guo, Guibo Luo, Xiaonan Luo, Feng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGM-Pose introduces a lightweight single-branch network with global modeling to improve multi-person pose estimation, reducing parameters and latency while outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-branch CNN architectures struggle with global context and high latency, motivating a simpler, more efficient solution.

Method: Uses a MobileViM Block with LARM for global info and SFusion for multi-scale integration.

Result: Outperforms mainstream methods on COCO and MPII with fewer parameters and faster speeds.

Conclusion: LGM-Pose offers a lightweight, efficient alternative for pose estimation with superior performance.

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods
are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often
struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically
complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and
redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight
global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In
the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed
Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates
information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation
Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel
Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively
integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often
observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and
MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of
parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also
achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

*Yue Ma, Kunyu Feng, Xinhua Zhang, Hongyu Liu, David Junhao Zhang, Jinbo Xing, Yinhan Zhang, Ayden Yang, Zeyu Wang, Qifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Follow-Your-Creation is a 4D video framework for generating and editing content from monocular video, using video inpainting as a generative prior and composite masks for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable flexible 4D video creation and editing from a single monocular video input, addressing challenges like camera trajectory changes and user edits.

Method: Leverages video inpainting, depth-based point cloud rendering for invisibility masks, and composite masks for training. Includes self-iterative tuning and temporal packaging for consistency.

Result: Generates 4D videos with multi-view coherence, supports prompt-based editing, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quality and versatility.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines prior knowledge with novel training strategies, offering robust and flexible 4D video generation and editing.

Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework
capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video
input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a
generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,
enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory
changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked
inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video
generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first
perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that
indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks
are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined
with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During
training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and
challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and
robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal
consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning
strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the
model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning
iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference
to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior
knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,
enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In
addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating
strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
both quality and versatility.

*Ziqi Jia, Anmin Wang, Xiaoyang Qu, Xiaowen Yang, Jianzong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HEC and Task-aware MoILE for hierarchical continual learning in embodied agents, reducing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the neglect of high-level planning and multi-level knowledge in continual learning for embodied intelligence.

Method: Proposes HEC with two learning layers and Task-aware MoILE, using clustering and dual routers for LoRA expert selection, with SVD to mitigate forgetting.

Result: Outperforms others in reducing forgetting, enabling agents to retain prior knowledge while learning new tasks.

Conclusion: HEC and Task-aware MoILE effectively support hierarchical continual learning and mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on
executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to
learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues,
we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that
divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level
instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning
sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of
Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task
recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level
router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To
effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks,
preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The
experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting
of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in
retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

*Alexander Huang-Menders, Xinhang Liu, Andy Xu, Yuyao Zhang, Chi-Keung Tang, Yu-Wing Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmartAvatar is a framework for creating customizable, animation-ready 3D avatars from photos or text, using vision-language models and iterative AI-guided refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack precise control over human identity, body shape, and animation readiness. SmartAvatar addresses this by integrating VLMs and parametric human generators.

Method: Leverages VLMs and parametric generators with an autonomous verification loop for iterative refinement via natural-language feedback.

Result: Outperforms other systems in mesh quality, identity fidelity, and animation readiness, suitable for consumer hardware.

Conclusion: SmartAvatar offers a versatile, user-involved approach for high-quality, customizable avatar generation.

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully
rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt.
While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object
generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity,
body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the
commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in
combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver
high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous
verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial
similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively
adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided
refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body
features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via
natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static
pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users
into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven
procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully
rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,
making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.
Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar
outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of
reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and
animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable
avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage framework, Perfecting Depth, enhances sensor depth by combining stochastic uncertainty modeling and deterministic refinement for reliable, artifact-free depth maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unreliable depth regions in sensor data while preserving geometric cues, improving depth map reliability for applications like autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: 1. Stochastic estimation: Detects unreliable regions and infers geometry using domain gaps. 2. Deterministic refinement: Ensures structural consistency and accuracy using uncertainty maps.

Result: Produces dense, artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability, validated by experiments and theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: The framework sets a new baseline for depth enhancement, showing robustness and scalability for real-world applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement, called
Perfecting Depth. This framework leverages the stochastic nature of diffusion
models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving
geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method
identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging
a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic
refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using
the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic
uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense,
artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations
validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for
sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving,
robotics, and immersive technologies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey on how deep learning has transformed traditional image matching pipelines, covering learnable replacements and end-to-end modules, with benchmarks and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image matching pipelines struggle in challenging scenarios, prompting the need for deep-learning advancements to improve robustness and accuracy.

Method: The survey reviews deep-learning transformations of classical pipelines, including learnable components (detector-descriptor, outlier filter, geometric estimator) and end-to-end modules (sparse/dense matchers, pose regressor).

Result: Benchmarks on tasks like pose recovery and homography estimation highlight the effectiveness of deep-learning approaches.

Conclusion: The survey provides a clear overview of deep-learning-driven image matching, identifies challenges, and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to
recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer
vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual
localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature
matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging
scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both
robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by
comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the
classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the
traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps
in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable
detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the
merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing
middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose
regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations
of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose
recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.
By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies,
this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape
and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

*Linjie Li, Mahtab Bigverdi, Jiawei Gu, Zixian Ma, Yinuo Yang, Ziang Li, Yejin Choi, Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STARE is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs on spatial reasoning tasks, showing models struggle with complex visual simulations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI benchmarks focus on verbal reasoning, neglecting non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation tasks essential for spatial cognition.

Method: STARE includes 4K tasks covering geometric transformations, integrated spatial reasoning, and real-world spatial challenges.

Result: Models perform well on simple 2D tasks but poorly on complex ones (e.g., 3D cube folding). Humans outperform models but benefit from visual simulations.

Conclusion: Models lack effective use of intermediate visual information, highlighting a gap in spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling
problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal
reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning,
neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We
introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark
designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks
better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks
spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial
reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial
reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive
challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and
everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at
reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance
on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require
multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take
considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up
(down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In
contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual
simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like
tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0
Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage
intermediate visual information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TADiSR is a diffusion-based SR framework that improves text legibility in super-resolved images using text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models for image super-resolution often distort text structures, prompting the need for a method that preserves both natural details and text fidelity.

Method: TADiSR integrates text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders, along with a pipeline for synthesizing high-quality images with text masks.

Result: The framework enhances text legibility and achieves state-of-the-art performance in super-resolution, with strong real-world generalization.

Conclusion: TADiSR effectively addresses fidelity issues in text regions while maintaining high-quality super-resolution results.

Abstract: The introduction of generative models has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR) in handling real-world degradations. However, they often
incur fidelity-related issues, particularly distorting textual structures. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based SR framework, namely TADiSR,
which integrates text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders to
recover not only natural details but also the structural fidelity of text
regions in degraded real-world images. Moreover, we propose a complete pipeline
for synthesizing high-quality images with fine-grained full-image text masks,
combining realistic foreground text regions with detailed background content.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances text
legibility in super-resolved images, achieving state-of-the-art performance
across multiple evaluation metrics and exhibiting strong generalization to
real-world scenarios. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPSAttention combines FP8 quantization and sparsity for faster video generation without quality loss, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow inference speeds and high computational demands of diffusion models hinder practical deployment.

Method: FPSAttention introduces joint optimization of FP8 quantization and sparsity with 3D tile-wise granularity, denoising step-awareness, and hardware-friendly kernels.

Result: Achieves 7.09x kernel speedup for attention and 4.96x end-to-end speedup at 720p without quality loss.

Conclusion: FPSAttention effectively accelerates video generation while maintaining quality, making it practical for deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing
high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high
computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization
and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining
generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing
training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to
the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel
training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation,
with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach
features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that
simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising
step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong
correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A
native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is
implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient
execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench
benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention
operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the
BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

*Takayuki Komatsu, Yoshiyuki Ohmura, Kayato Nishitsunoi, Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to apply group decomposition theory to realistic scenarios by combining feature extraction and object segmentation, addressing limitations of conventional representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional representation learning, which assumes disentangled independent feature axes but fails to account for conditional independence, and to extend the applicability of group decomposition theory to real-world scenarios.

Method: The study combines feature extraction and object segmentation, replacing pixel translation with feature translation and grouping features under the same transformation.

Result: The proposed method was validated on a practical dataset with real-world objects and backgrounds, showing promise for realistic applications.

Conclusion: The model advances representation learning by addressing real-world constraints and may improve understanding of human object recognition development.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FSPCC, a framework improving SEMs in data-scarce settings by addressing parametric imbalance and representation misalignment, achieving notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEMs struggle in low-data regimes, leading to suboptimal performance and interpretability issues.

Method: FSPCC uses MoLE for parameter-efficient adaptation, cross-module concept guidance, multi-level feature preservation, and a geometry-aware concept discrimination loss.

Result: Outperforms existing SEMs by 4.2%-8.7% in 5-way 5-shot classification on six benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining concept learning with few-shot adaptation enhances accuracy and interpretability, advancing transparent visual recognition.

Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to
enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often
struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to
suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot
Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically
mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and
representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of
LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced
allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL
module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment
between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept
activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature
preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various
layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the
challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance
interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware
concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,
encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental
results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%
relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the
efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both
higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more
transparent visual recognition systems.

TL;DR: MARS, a multi-scale aware radiomap super-resolution method, combines CNNs and Transformers to improve radio map reconstruction accuracy by leveraging global and local features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate radio maps are crucial for smart cities and IoT, but existing methods lack environmental awareness or depend on detailed scene data, limiting generalization.

Method: MARS integrates CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections to enhance feature representation across different scales.

Result: MARS outperforms baseline models in MSE and SSIM across various scenes and antenna locations, with low computational cost.

Conclusion: MARS demonstrates strong practical potential for accurate radio map reconstruction.

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoliSafe, a comprehensive safety dataset and benchmark for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM with safety enhancements, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM safety approaches are limited by partial coverage of harmful content and reliance on data-centric tuning, leaving models vulnerable to unseen attacks.

Method: Proposes HoliSafe, a holistic safety dataset, and SafeLLaVA, a VLM with a learnable safety meta token and safety head for intrinsic safety.

Result: SafeLLaVA trained on HoliSafe achieves top safety performance, and HoliSafe exposes vulnerabilities in existing models.

Conclusion: HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA advance robust and interpretable VLM safety, encouraging future multimodal alignment research.

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multimodal models internally represent visual concepts and whether these representations are shared across text and image modalities.

Method: Analyzes LlaVA-Next's hidden activations, tests causality via targeted edits, and trains multimodal Sparse Autoencoders to study feature diversity and interpretability.

Result: ImageNet classes are represented via linearly decodable features, which are causal. Deeper layers show increasing shared representations across text and image modalities.

Conclusion: Multimodal models exhibit diverse, interpretable image representations, with deeper layers fostering shared features across modalities.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SRAPF, a method for robust few-shot adaptation of pretrained VLMs, enhancing both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy through partial finetuning and augmentation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of OOD generalization in few-shot VLM adaptation, aiming to improve both ID and OOD accuracy.

Method: Compares adaptation methods, identifies key findings, and introduces SRAPF—a two-stage approach combining retrieval augmentation and adversarial perturbation for partial finetuning.

Result: SRAPF achieves state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on ImageNet OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Partial finetuning with strategic augmentation techniques (retrieval and adversarial) optimizes ID and OOD performance, with SRAPF outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted
with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)
task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot
adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,
aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full
finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper
hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods
prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves
better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and
textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides
the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we
propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple
augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves
task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,
and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.
Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly
sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining
the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma
with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial
Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the
visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial
finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF
achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD
benchmarks.

*Zelu Qi, Ping Shi, Chaoyang Zhang, Shuqi Wang, Fei Zhao, Da Pan, Zefeng Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automatic visual quality assessment method for AI-Generated Videos (AIGVs) by decomposing quality into technical, motion, and semantic dimensions, using LLMs and multi-modal prompts for effective evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGVs suffer from visual defects like noise and blurriness, impacting user experience, necessitating an automated quality assessment method for content regulation and model improvement.

Method: Decomposes AIGV quality into technical, motion, and semantic dimensions, designs encoders for each, and uses LLMs with multi-modal prompts and LoRA fine-tuning for quality regression.

Result: Achieved second place in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment Challenge for AI-Generated Videos, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively assesses AIGV quality, leveraging LLMs and multi-modal features, and shows promise for future applications.

Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable
in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content
production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,
such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely
impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual
quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and
generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of
AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video
semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve
effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding
performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language
tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable
the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features
and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt
engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology
during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.
Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality
Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge: Track 2 AI Generated video,

### [214] [Learning dissection trajectories from expert surgical videos via imitation learning with equivariant diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04716)
*Hongyu Wang, Yonghao Long, Yueyao Chen, Hon-Chi Yip, Markus Scheppach, Philip Wai-Yan Chiu, Yeung Yam, Helen Mei-Ling Meng, Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces iDPOE, a novel imitation learning method for predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos, improving surgical training and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos can enhance surgical training, but existing methods struggle with uncertainty, geometric symmetries, and generalization.

Method: iDPOE uses a diffusion model and equivariant representations to model expert behavior, enabling robust learning and conditional sampling for state mismatches.

Result: Experiments on 2000 ESD clips show iDPOE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: iDPOE is the first imitation learning approach for surgical skill development in dissection trajectory prediction, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for
removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos
offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and
simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While
imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert
demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,
learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.
To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with
Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models
expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the
stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual
representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a
diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and
sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.
Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric
symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address
state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy
for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,
experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical
skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

Motivation: To reduce manual annotation efforts in industrial inspection systems by leveraging AI for auto-labeling of display panel defects.

Method: Enhanced SegGPT architecture with domain-specific training techniques and a scribble-based annotation mechanism, validated via a two-stage training approach.

Result: Achieved an average IoU increase of 0.22, 14% recall improvement, and 60% auto-labeling coverage, matching human-labeled data performance.

Abstract: This paper presents an AI-assisted auto-labeling system for display panel
defect detection that leverages in-context learning capabilities. We adopt and
enhance the SegGPT architecture with several domain-specific training
techniques and introduce a scribble-based annotation mechanism to streamline
the labeling process. Our two-stage training approach, validated on industrial
display panel datasets, demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline
model, achieving an average IoU increase of 0.22 and a 14% improvement in
recall across multiple product types, while maintaining approximately 60%

*Mikhail Kennerley, Angelica Alives-Reviro, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAT is a label transfer framework that aligns annotations from diverse datasets into a target label space, improving detection performance without manual relabeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inconsistencies in class semantics and bounding box annotations when combining multiple object detection datasets.

Method: Uses dataset-specific detectors for pseudo-labels, a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG), and a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module to refine features.

Result: Achieves up to +4.8AP improvement over semi-supervised baselines.

Conclusion: LAT effectively handles class-level and spatial inconsistencies without shared label spaces or manual annotations.

Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved
generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and
bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label
taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual
relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a
fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),
a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from
diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by
training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then
combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator
(PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To
further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects
class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a
confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves
dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space
transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and
spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.
LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box
inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.
Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in
target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over
semi-supervised baselines.

*Shuhan Xu, Siyuan Liang, Hongling Zheng, Yong Luo, Aishan Liu, Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are vulnerable to stealthy backdoor attacks. The proposed Semantic Reward Defense (SRD) mitigates these attacks using reinforcement learning, reducing success rates to 5.6% while preserving caption quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies reveal VLMs' susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where imperceptible perturbations cause malicious captions. The stealthiness and cross-modal nature of these attacks make detection and defense challenging.

Method: The paper introduces Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework using a Deep Q-Network. SRD applies discrete perturbations to sensitive image regions and uses a semantic fidelity score as a reward to guide robust caption generation.

Result: SRD reduces attack success rates to 5.6% and maintains caption quality on clean inputs with less than a 10% performance drop.

Conclusion: SRD provides a trigger-agnostic, interpretable defense against backdoor attacks in VLMs, offering a practical solution for secure multimodal generative models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image
captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers
or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to
generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These
attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal
nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)
abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic
drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose
Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that
mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a
Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,
occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the
activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the
reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic
fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful
captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces
attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs
with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,
interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal
generative models.

*Yijun Cao, Fuya Luo, Yongjie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modified SSIM function for unsupervised monocular depth learning, improving gradient smoothness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore the impact of SSIM components and hyperparameters on training.

Method: Introduces a new SSIM form using addition instead of multiplication for combining components.

Result: The optimized SSIM loss outperforms the baseline on KITTI-2015.

Conclusion: The new SSIM form enhances unsupervised depth estimation performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric
relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean
absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with
conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of
different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters
on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of
SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition
rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural
similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this
scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on
unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine
the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the
popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably
outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HypeVPR introduces a hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space for Visual Place Recognition (VPR), leveraging panoramic views' hierarchical structures for efficient and accurate matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address diverse query images from various viewpoints in real-world VPR applications, where perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation is suitable.

Method: HypeVPR uses hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical feature relationships and a coarse-to-fine search strategy for efficient matching.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to 5x faster retrieval across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HypeVPR effectively balances speed and accuracy in VPR by leveraging hierarchical structures in hyperbolic space.

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and
similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation
naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images
captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel
hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the
unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual
environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical
structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent
hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the
feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation
mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within
hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine
search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust
matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach
enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse
benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at
https://github.com/suhan-woo/HypeVPR.git.

*Gaia Di Lorenzo, Federico Tombari, Marc Pollefeys, Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-X is a multi-modal 3D object representation framework that encodes rich embeddings (images, point clouds, text) and decodes them into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions, supporting various downstream tasks with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack versatility, as they focus on either semantic understanding or geometric reconstruction, limiting their reuse across tasks. Object-X aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Object-X grounds modalities in a 3D voxel grid, fuses them with object attributes into an unstructured embedding, and uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction.

Result: Object-X achieves high-fidelity novel-view synthesis, improves geometric accuracy, and performs competitively in scene alignment and localization while requiring significantly less storage.

Conclusion: Object-X is a scalable and practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation, outperforming specialized methods in versatility and efficiency.

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for
numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods
often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic
understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings
typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused
across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal
object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings
(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric
and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the
captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding
fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned
embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also
supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image
3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging
real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view
synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly
improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive
performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.
Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less
storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,
establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for
multi-modal 3D scene representation.

TL;DR: LotusFilter is a fast post-processing module to diversify ANNS results by precomputing a cutoff table and greedily removing redundant vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS results can be overly similar, but some applications require diversity in search results.

Method: Precompute a cutoff table of close vectors and greedily remove redundancies during filtering.

Result: Operates fast (0.02 ms/query) in real-world RAG settings using OpenAI embeddings.

Conclusion: LotusFilter effectively diversifies ANNS results efficiently, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

TL;DR: SupeRANSAC is a unified RANSAC pipeline designed for robust geometric model estimation in computer vision, outperforming existing methods like OpenCV and PoseLib.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust estimation is crucial for tasks like Structure-from-Motion and SLAM, but RANSAC's performance varies due to implementation details. SupeRANSAC aims to provide consistent accuracy across tasks.

Method: Introduces SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, analyzing techniques for tasks like homography and pose estimation.

Result: Improves performance by 6 AUC points on average for fundamental matrix estimation and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SupeRANSAC offers significant improvements in accuracy and consistency for geometric model estimation in computer vision.

Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks
like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC
and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,
homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite
RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across
different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on
improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall
performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e.,
the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given
library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying
performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce
SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of
the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including
homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.
SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving
upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for
fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately recognizing the vast number of Chinese characters (87,887 categories in GB18030-2022) for cultural preservation and digital applications, given the absence of large datasets.

Method: Creation of MegaHan97K, a dataset with 97,455 categories, featuring balanced samples across handwritten, historical, and synthetic subsets to address long-tail distribution.

Result: Benchmarking reveals new challenges like storage demands, similar character recognition, and zero-shot learning, while opening research opportunities.

Conclusion: MegaHan97K is a groundbreaking dataset for mega-category recognition, likely the largest in OCR and pattern recognition, available for public use.

Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters
encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the
latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate
recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category
recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage
preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due
to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset
containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce
MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented
97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major
contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest
GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than
existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution
problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three
distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)
Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category
scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar
character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also
unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our
knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not
only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern
recognition. The dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras outperform traditional sensors but struggle with noise when converting event streams for standard vision pipelines.

Method: Proposes Spike-TBR, integrating TBR with spiking neurons for noise filtering, evaluated with four variants across datasets.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in noisy and clean data scenarios, bridging spike-based and frame-based processing.

Conclusion: Spike-TBR offers a robust, noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range.
However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with
standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly
in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel
event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR),
addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR
combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering
capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation
of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different
spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance
in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our
method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering
a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite successful adversarial attacks on autonomous vehicle perception tasks, few works focus on traffic light detectors. This work addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes a threat model with patches placed under traffic lights and a training strategy for CNN-based detectors. Evaluates attacks in universal settings and real-world scenarios.

Result: Successful targeted attacks (e.g., red-to-green label flipping) and pictogram classification attacks. Real-world validation with printed patches.

Conclusion: Adversarial patches can effectively deceive traffic light detectors, highlighting vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicle perception systems.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualX-VSR introduces a dual axial attention mechanism for video super-resolution, eliminating motion compensation and improving fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models struggle with pixel-level precision in VSR due to tokenization and sequential attention, and existing solutions have limited receptive fields and rely on optical flow.

Method: Proposes DualX-VSR with a dual axial spatial×temporal attention mechanism, integrating spatial and temporal information orthogonally without motion compensation.

Result: DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR.

Conclusion: DualX-VSR simplifies spatiotemporal modeling and outperforms existing transformer-based VSR methods.

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured
significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user
intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks
based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and
structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces
OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and
segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to
produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing
a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation
mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud
segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results
on large-scale ScanNet datasets validate the effectiveness of our
OpenMaskDINO3D across various tasks.

TL;DR: A new method for reconstructing geological fields using tensor completion outperforms ordinary kriging in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reconstruction of multidimensional geological fields from sparse observations by leveraging tensor completion and geostatistics.

Method: Model the field as a multidimensional tensor and recover missing values by enforcing a global low-rank structure, combining tensor completion and geostatistics.

Result: Experiments show significant accuracy improvements over ordinary kriging for various observation percentages.

Conclusion: The proposed tensor completion method is effective for reconstructing geological fields from sparse data.

Abstract: We present a new viewpoint on a reconstructing multidimensional geological

inpainting techniques, we model a partially observed spatial field as a
multidimensional tensor and recover missing values by enforcing a global

*Yu-Feng Chen, Tzuhsuan Huang, Pin-Yen Chiu, Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel backdoor attack framework for diffusion models in image editing, using invisible triggers via poisoned training data and deep watermarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks in diffusion models focus on image generation, with image editing attacks relying on visible triggers, which are impractical.

Method: The method embeds invisible triggers using deep watermarking models, ensuring normal editing for clean images while triggering predefined outputs for watermarked inputs.

Result: The framework achieves high attack success rates across various watermarking models, with analysis confirming the effectiveness of the invisible triggers.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates the feasibility of stealthy backdoor attacks in image editing, supported by experimental results and watermark analysis.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation
and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can
manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has
proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving
backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies
targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical
because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds
invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.
We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible
watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the
predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing
clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments
across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising
attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark
characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of
our approach. The code is available

*Andrew Hamara, Greg Hamerly, Pablo Rivas, Andrew C. Freeman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer encoder is trained using supervised contrastive learning to embed chess board states into a latent space, enabling intuitive move selection without deep search, achieving a high Elo rating of 2593.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model human-like intuition-driven planning in chess, contrasting with traditional deep search methods used by engines.

Method: Supervised contrastive learning trains a transformer encoder to embed board states into a structured latent space, where move selection is guided by positional evaluation.

Result: The model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593 with only a 6-ply beam search, showing performance scaling with model size and embedding dimensionality.

Conclusion: Latent planning offers a viable alternative to deep search, generalizable to other perfect-information games with learnable state evaluations.

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search
and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select
candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this
intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using
supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space
structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects
evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable
transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur
entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,
without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our
model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both
model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may
offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,
the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other
perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable. All source

### [231] [From Objects to Anywhere: A Holistic Benchmark for Multi-level Visual Grounding in 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04897)
*Tianxu Wang, Zhuofan Zhang, Ziyu Zhu, Yue Fan, Jing Xiong, Pengxiang Li, Xiaojian Ma, Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Anywhere3D-Bench introduces a 3D visual grounding benchmark with four levels (human-activity areas, unoccupied space, objects, and parts), revealing challenges in space- and part-level tasks for current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and benchmark 3D visual grounding beyond object-level semantics, addressing gaps in spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception.

Method: Developed Anywhere3D-Bench with 2,632 expression-bounding box pairs across four grounding levels, testing SOTA methods, LLMs, and MLLMs.

Result: Space- and part-level tasks are most challenging, with top model OpenAI o4-mini achieving only 23.57% and 33.94% accuracy, respectively.

Conclusion: Current models lack comprehensive spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception for 3D scenes beyond object-level tasks.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within
complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in
3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a
holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring
expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels:
human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene,
and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual
grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and
part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks
require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling
distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand
fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model,
OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94%
on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and
object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models'
capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for stereo dataset generation is proposed, outperforming NeRF-based methods and leveraging expert knowledge transfer for improved geometry estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an efficient alternative to NeRF-based methods for stereo dataset generation and improve zero-shot generalization performance.

Method: Utilizes reconstructed geometry from 3DGS and depth estimates from FoundationStereo in an expert knowledge transfer setup.

Result: 3DGS-generated datasets enable competitive zero-shot generalization, with FoundationStereo's disparity estimates yielding cleaner results than direct geometry.

Conclusion: The method offers low-cost, high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning, though 3DGS robustness in challenging settings needs further exploration.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for
stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore
utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as
well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge
transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated
datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization
benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it
is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained
model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo
are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot
generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,
high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.
Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods
have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness
falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

*Antoine Laurent, Jean Mélou, Catherine Schwab, Rolande Simon-Millot, Sophie Féret, Thomas Sagory, Carole Fritz, Jean-Denis Durou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of tailored 3D digitization methods for heritage objects, emphasizing the need for collaboration between heritage and digital experts to choose the best method for each object.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to highlight the diversity of 3D digitization methods and the necessity of selecting the most suitable one for each heritage object, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all approach.

Method: The study uses objects from the musée d'Archéologie nationale to demonstrate that no single 3D digitization method is universally applicable, advocating for a collaborative selection process.

Result: The findings show that existing tools may need adaptation for each object, and an absolute classification of methods is impractical.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the best digital tool for each object should be chosen based on its characteristics and the intended use of its digital twin.

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article
presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It
illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is
not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of
the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is
suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object
should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage
and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the
adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an
absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to
find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only
its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

TL;DR: CzechLynx is a large-scale dataset for Eurasian lynx identification, pose estimation, and segmentation, featuring real and synthetic images with diverse annotations and evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open-access datasets for individual animal re-identification and related tasks, particularly for the Eurasian lynx.

Method: The dataset combines 30k real camera trap images and 100k synthetic images generated via Unity and diffusion models, annotated with masks, labels, and skeletons. Three evaluation protocols (geo-aware, time-aware open-set, and closed-set) are defined.

Result: CzechLynx includes 219 unique lynx individuals across 15 years, with diverse annotations and synthetic data for variability.

Conclusion: The dataset aims to benchmark and advance models for animal re-identification and related tasks.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just
individual animal re-identification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video-Based Embryo Grading, a new AI task using full-length TLM videos to predict embryo quality, addressing limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI approaches for IVF embryo selection lack holistic quality assessment or are confounded by external factors, limiting clinical utility.

Method: Proposes a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern Mining (CoSTeM) framework with morphological and morphokinetic branches to replicate embryologists' evaluation.

Result: The CoSTeM framework outperforms existing methods, demonstrating superior performance in embryo grading.

Conclusion: This work advances AI-assisted embryo selection with a novel framework and dataset, promising clinical impact.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo
selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either
address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target
clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both
limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called
Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes
full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'
overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world
clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a
grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical
decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern
Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'
evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological
branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal
Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a
morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global
developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic
determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological
framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

*Igor Meleshin, Anna Chistyakova, Anastasia Antsiferova, Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes designing robustness into Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models through architectural changes, rather than relying on data-driven defenses like adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IQA models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, undermining trust. Traditional defenses focus on data, but the authors question if robustness should instead be an inherent design feature.

Method: The approach enforces orthogonal information flow and norm-preserving operations, combined with pruning and fine-tuning, to create a robust architecture.

Result: The proposed IQA model resists adversarial attacks without adversarial training or major modifications to the original model.

Conclusion: The work advocates a paradigm shift: engineering robustness into perceptual models through design, not just optimizing it through data.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Hong Gao, Yiming Bao, Xuezhan Tu, Bin Zhong, Minling Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APVR is a training-free framework for hour-level video understanding, using hierarchical visual retrieval to overcome computational limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with long videos due to inefficiency and memory constraints.

Method: APVR uses Pivot Frame Retrieval and Pivot Token Retrieval for hierarchical, query-aware information extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongVideoBench and VideoMME, surpassing both training-free and training-based methods.

Conclusion: APVR enables efficient, high-fidelity processing of hour-long videos and integrates seamlessly with existing MLLMs.

Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level
video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient
information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR
(Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that
addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information
retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame
Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to
identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval
performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames.
This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while
maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and
VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing
state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based
approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing
MLLM architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FEAT is a Transformer-based model for dynamic medical video synthesis, addressing limitations like insufficient channel interactions and high computational complexity. It introduces sequential attention mechanisms, linear-complexity design, and fine-grained guidance, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer-based methods for dynamic medical video synthesis struggle with channel interactions, computational complexity, and coarse denoising guidance. FEAT aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: FEAT uses sequential spatial-temporal-channel attention, linear-complexity attention mechanisms, and a residual value guidance module for fine-grained noise adaptation.

Result: FEAT-S achieves comparable performance to Endora with fewer parameters, while FEAT-L outperforms all benchmarks in effectiveness and scalability.

Conclusion: FEAT demonstrates superior performance and scalability in dynamic medical video synthesis, offering a more efficient and effective solution than existing methods.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant
challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal
dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations,
including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from
self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when
handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a
full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues
through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential
spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies
across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms
in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel
attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained
pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on
standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only
23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves
comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all
comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior
effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at

*Mélisande Teng, Arthur Ouaknine, Etienne Laliberté, Yoshua Bengio, David Rolnick, Hugo Larochelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and elevation data (DSM) for automatic tree crown segmentation in drone imagery, comparing methods across boreal, temperate, and tropical forests. BalSAM, integrating SAM and DSM, shows promise, especially in plantations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ground-based tree monitoring is costly and labor-intensive. Drone remote sensing and computer vision, particularly SAM, offer scalable solutions for individual tree mapping.

Method: Comparison of SAM-based methods for tree crown segmentation in drone imagery across three forest types, with DSM integration. BalSAM combines SAM and DSM.

Result: SAM out-of-the-box underperforms custom Mask R-CNN, but tuning SAM and integrating DSM (as in BalSAM) show potential, especially in plantations.

Conclusion: Efficient SAM tuning and DSM integration are promising for tree crown segmentation, with BalSAM demonstrating advantages in specific contexts.

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest
ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve
ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in
drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping
individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision
models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly
compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods
leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in
high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2)
temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of
elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)
information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone
imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which
shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.
We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask
R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM
end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree
crown instance segmentation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextVidBench, a benchmark for long-video text question answering, addressing limitations of existing datasets. It features cross-domain videos, a three-stage evaluation framework, and high-quality annotations. The proposed method enhances temporal perception and handles long sequences efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for short-video Text-Visual Question Answering (ViteVQA) are limited in duration and scope, failing to assess multimodal large language models (MLLMs) adequately for long-video understanding.

Method: The authors propose TextVidBench, a benchmark with long videos (>3 minutes) and a three-stage evaluation framework. They introduce IT-Rope mechanism, temporal prompt engineering, non-uniform positional encoding, and lightweight fine-tuning to improve model performance.

Result: TextVidBench challenges existing models, and the proposed method shows promise in enhancing long-video text understanding.

Conclusion: TextVidBench fills a gap in long-video QA evaluation, and the proposed techniques offer insights for improving MLLMs in this domain.

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering
(ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing
datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes,
making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for
long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key
contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories
(e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds,
enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A
three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal
Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained
annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic
labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large
models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt
engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform
positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying
lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple
public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark
presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method
offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding
capabilities.

*Enrique Sanchez, Isma Hadji, Adrian Bulat, Christos Tzelepis, Brais Martinez, Georgios Tzimiropoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to Image Super Resolution (ISR) using Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling, addressing limitations of prior work with hierarchical tokenization and preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve ISR by leveraging VAR modeling while overcoming fixed-resolution and large-scale data dependencies of existing methods like VARSR.

Method: The method involves a Hierarchical Image Tokenization for multi-scale representation and a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) term to guide the transformer.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art ISR results with a smaller architecture (300M params) and no external data, enabling single-pass denoising and super-resolution.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed components enable efficient and effective ISR, outperforming prior work without relying on large datasets or models.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances
in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the
residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process
referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during
pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only
VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,
due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a
fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the
corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer
architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve
state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel
components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale
image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while
simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the
LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is
trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the
first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using
these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at
half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we
achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model
(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PATS is a new video sampling method for sports skill assessment that preserves full movements, outperforming current methods in accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video sampling disrupts temporal continuity, hindering accurate skill assessment. PATS aims to preserve movement integrity for better evaluation.

Method: PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure full execution of critical movements, repeating across segments for comprehensive coverage.

Result: PATS improves accuracy (+0.65% to +3.05%) and excels in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball).

Conclusion: PATS is an effective, adaptive temporal sampling method that enhances automated skill assessment for diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

### [243] [Beyond Cropped Regions: New Benchmark and Corresponding Baseline for Chinese Scene Text Retrieval in Diverse Layouts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04999)
*Gengluo Li, Huawen Shen, Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark (DL-CSVTR) and model (CSTR-CLIP) for Chinese scene text retrieval address diverse layouts, outperforming prior methods by 18.82% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Chinese scene text retrieval, derived from English solutions, fail to handle complex layouts. A dedicated benchmark and model are needed.

Method: Proposes CSTR-CLIP, integrating global visual info and multi-granularity alignment training in two stages to address layout diversity.

Result: CSTR-CLIP achieves 18.82% higher accuracy and faster inference than previous models, excelling on DL-CSVTR.

Conclusion: CSTR-CLIP effectively handles diverse Chinese text layouts, with public dataset and code to aid future research.

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for
images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is
extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse
layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for
English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In
this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View
Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval
performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and
partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose
Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates
global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP
applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as
the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on
single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle
diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also
provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the
superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset
and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene
text retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses advancements in monocular depth estimation using deep learning, highlighting challenges in generalization and recent methods like Depth Anything for zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve monocular depth estimation by leveraging deep learning and addressing generalization issues across unseen domains.

Method: Utilizes multi-scale fusion networks, reinterprets regression as classification, incorporates priors, and employs affine-invariant loss for multi-dataset training.

Result: Depth Anything shows leading zero-shot performance but struggles with metric depth accuracy, excelling in structural detail extraction.

Conclusion: While progress has been made, challenges in generalization and metric depth estimation persist, with Depth Anything emerging as a strong zero-shot solution.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an
RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has
significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth
features from some well-annotated datasets
\cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et
al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for
depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from
reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem
\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors
\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective
function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these
advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several
methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint
training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth
Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the
lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information
from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

*Alfred T. Christiansen, Andreas H. Højrup, Morten K. Stephansen, Md Ibtihaj A. Sakib, Taman S. Poojary, Filip Slezak, Morten S. Laursen, Thomas B. Moeslund, Joakim B. Haurum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline generates synthetic 3D point cloud data using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian Opacity Fields, avoiding costly real-world data collection. Synthetic data-trained models, like PTv3, achieved high accuracy (91.35% mIoU) and even outperformed real-data-trained models in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world 3D point cloud data collection and annotation are expensive and labor-intensive, necessitating a cost-effective synthetic alternative.

Method: The pipeline uses 3DGS and GOF to create realistic 3D assets of agricultural vehicles, simulates environments with LiDAR, and trains segmentation models (PointNet++, PTv3, OACNN) solely on synthetic data.

Result: PTv3 achieved 91.35% mIoU without real data training, and synthetic data sometimes outperformed real data. Models generalized well to unseen mesh models.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation is a viable, flexible alternative to real-world data, enabling high-performance models and cost savings.

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating
real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to
introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by
leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to
generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using
generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the
point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach
that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional
costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as
PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the
models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of
91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor
validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain
scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed
better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments
demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling
accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

*Jaehoon Choi, Dongki Jung, Christopher Maxey, Yonghan Lee, Sungmin Eum, Dinesh Manocha, Heesung Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAV4D is a framework for photorealistic rendering of UAV-captured dynamic scenes with multiple moving pedestrians, addressing monocular camera challenges and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic neural rendering methods struggle with UAV-captured scenarios, especially monocular setups and top-down perspectives with multiple small, moving humans, lacking in datasets.

Method: Combines a 3D foundation model and human mesh reconstruction to reconstruct scenes and humans, resolves scale ambiguity using human-scene contact points, and initializes Gaussian splats for rendering.

Result: Achieves 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual sharpness on datasets like VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and Okutama-Action.

Conclusion: UAV4D effectively addresses UAV-specific challenges, enabling high-quality dynamic scene rendering without additional sensors.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing
methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios,
particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and
multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing
datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling
photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.
Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with
multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for
additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human
mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.
We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both
humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact
points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to
initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our
method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and
Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our
results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel
view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual
sharpness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel physical annotation system for automated optical inspection captures expert input via tracked pointers, improving data labeling efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between human expertise and machine learning by enabling non-IT experts to contribute to training data generation.

Method: Uses calibrated, tracked pointers and a projector-based interface to record physical interactions and convert them into standardized annotations.

Result: Preliminary results confirm feasibility and integration with CVAT for streamlined ML workflows.

Conclusion: The system enhances ML data generation for optical inspection, leveraging human expertise effectively.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate
training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based
in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection
personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike
conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical
trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive
and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked
pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial
interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

*Guangzhao Li, Yanming Yang, Chenxi Song, Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDirector is an inversion-free video editing framework using ODEs and attention-guided masking for coherent, localized edits with strong semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity in inversion-based video editing methods.

Method: Models editing as ODE-guided evolution in data space with attention-guided masking and guidance-enhanced editing for semantic alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency, and background preservation.

Conclusion: FlowDirector establishes a new paradigm for efficient, coherent video editing without inversion.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural
language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress
by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on
inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which
often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To
address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing
framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in
data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby
preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and
controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that
modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially
and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic
alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing
strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential
signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward
stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves
state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,
and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and
coherent video editing without inversion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing real image editing by improving instruction adherence and content preservation, leveraging T2I models and scalable data curation.

Method: Developed an enhanced data curation pipeline with meta-info, introduced joint learning for diffusion and reward losses, and upgraded the T2I model.

Result: Achieved a 56.1% usability rate, outperforming SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%), and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

Conclusion: SeedEdit 3.0 offers a superior trade-off in real image editing, validated by benchmark performance.

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22],
which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of
edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real
image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we
present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation
pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help
mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data
effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion
model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for
computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0
on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best
trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%,
compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) combining vision and language models to assess streetscapes, achieving high accuracy and alignment with resident perceptions while revealing nuanced urban insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in capturing subjective perceptions in urban design, which objective metrics fail to measure, by integrating interpretable AI models.

Method: Uses a vision transformer (VisualGLM-6B) and GPT-4, fine-tuned with LoRA and P-Tuning v2 on 15,000 annotated street-view images from Harbin, China.

Result: Achieves an F1 score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3% agreement with resident perceptions, uncovering context-dependent contradictions and nonlinear patterns.

Conclusion: MSEF bridges sensory data and socio-affective inference, offering methodological innovation and practical utility for urban planning aligned with SDG 11.

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASTRAEA is an automatic framework for optimizing video diffusion transformers (vDiTs), achieving significant speedups (up to 13.2x on 8 GPUs) with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demands of vDiTs limit practical deployment, and existing acceleration methods rely on heuristics, reducing applicability.

Method: ASTRAEA introduces a lightweight token selection mechanism, GPU-parallel sparse attention, and an evolutionary algorithm for token budget optimization.

Result: Achieves up to 2.4x speedup on a single GPU and 13.2x on 8 GPUs with <0.5% loss in VBench score.

Conclusion: ASTRAEA effectively balances speed and quality, making vDiTs more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in
text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major
challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce
workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting
their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal
configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a
lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel
sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with
minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for
different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a
classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of
the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference
speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)
while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods
(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

*Revant Teotia, Candace Ross, Karen Ullrich, Sumit Chopra, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Melissa Hall, Matthew J. Muckley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIM-CIM, a reference-free framework for measuring diversity in text-to-image models, addressing gaps in existing evaluation methods. It benchmarks models using COCO-DIMCIM and reveals trade-offs between generalization and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for text-to-image models lack adaptability and interpretability, requiring reference datasets or failing to specify diversity types.

Method: The authors propose the DIM-CIM framework, which measures default-mode diversity and generalization capacity without reference images. They create the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark using COCO concepts and LLM-augmented captions.

Result: Scaling models from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters improves generalization but reduces default-mode diversity. DIM-CIM identifies fine-grained failure cases and shows a 0.85 correlation between training data diversity and model diversity.

Conclusion: DIM-CIM offers a flexible, interpretable way to assess text-to-image model diversity and generalization, enhancing performance understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive
quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation
diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model
diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity
about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and
interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it
framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity
("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization
capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular
concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO
concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With
COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the
cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.
DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are
generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly
requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model
and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and
default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable
framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of model performance.

*Benedikt Hopf, Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) to improve deepfake detection under non-ideal conditions, enhancing robustness and performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detectors perform poorly under non-ideal conditions and are easily circumvented, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: Developed PMM with diverse forgeries (Poisson blending, varied masks, generator artifacts, distractors) and added strong degradations to training images.

Result: Improved robustness and performance, with AUC increases of 3.51% (DFDC) and 6.21% (DFDCP) over the state-of-the-art LAA backbone.

Conclusion: PMM significantly enhances deepfake detection robustness and performance, addressing limitations of previous detectors.

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the
challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal
conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets
and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more
real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have
developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of
possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson
blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.
Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding
strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes
not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image
degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC
and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,
we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements
in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIVET framework evaluates VLMs' understanding of object properties and relations, revealing limitations in accuracy, positional dependency, and relational comprehension compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess VLMs' scene comprehension, addressing gaps in standardized evaluation and uncontrolled biases.

Method: Introduces CIVET, a controlled framework for evaluating VLMs using noise-free stimuli, testing five state-of-the-art models.

Result: VLMs recognize limited basic properties, depend on object position, and struggle with relations, lagging behind human accuracy.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack robust scene understanding, highlighting the need for improved models and evaluation methods.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

Method: The authors created the FRED dataset, featuring 7+ hours of annotated drone trajectories from 5 drone models, including challenging conditions like rain and adverse lighting.

Result: FRED provides densely annotated data, evaluation protocols, and standard metrics for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory forecasting.

Conclusion: FRED aims to advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for
traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving
objects, especially under challenging lighting conditions. Event cameras offer
an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet
existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific
motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the
Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset
specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory
forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7
hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models
and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting
conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for
each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will
advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal
understanding.

*Tao Sun, Liyuan Zhu, Shengyu Huang, Shuran Song, Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified Point Flow unifies point cloud registration and shape assembly as a conditional generative problem, learning a velocity field for point transport and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior work in handling symmetries and part-wise poses, and to unify registration and assembly tasks.

Method: Learns a continuous point-wise velocity field to transport noisy points to target positions, with a self-supervised encoder for overlapping points.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks, with joint training enhancing accuracy.

Conclusion: The unified formulation and intrinsic symmetry learning enable superior performance and shared geometric priors.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

### [259] [Through-the-Wall Radar Human Activity Recognition WITHOUT Using Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05169)
*Weicheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neural-network-free method for through-the-wall radar human activity recognition, leveraging template matching and topological similarity for interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author aims to revisit traditional template-matching methods, which offer strong physical interpretability, instead of relying on neural networks for TWR HAR.

Method: Generates range-time and Doppler-time maps, segments micro-Doppler signatures using active contour models, discretizes features into point clouds, and calculates topological similarity with templates using the Mapper algorithm.

Result: The method's effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations and measured experiments.

Conclusion: The approach successfully achieves TWR HAR without neural networks, emphasizing interpretability and theoretical signal processing foundations.

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAO introduces a granular VAD framework integrating fine-grained anomaly detection and pixel-level tracking, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAD methods lack finer-grained analysis (e.g., anomalous pixels), limiting anomaly detection breadth.

Method: TAO transforms VAD into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects, linking scores to segmentation/tracking for precise localization without threshold tuning.

Result: TAO achieves superior accuracy and robustness in experiments, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: TAO's unified framework advances VAD by enabling fine-grained anomaly detection and precise localization in complex videos.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is
essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting
anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or
objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,
which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address
this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object
(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for
the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous
objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to
every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of
anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as
segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and
achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.
Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and
robustness. Project page available online.

*Neeraj Kumar, Swaraj Nanda, Siddharth Singi, Jamal Benhamida, David Kim, Jie-Fu Chen, Amir Momeni-Boroujeni, Gregory M. Goldgof, Gabriele Campanella, Chad Vanderbilt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAPFM proposes a method for adapting pathology foundation models (PFMs) for clinical tasks using vision transformer attention and MIL, achieving better performance on mutation prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting pretrained PFMs for clinical tasks is challenging due to weak WSI-level labels and the need for MIL.

Method: Uses vision transformer attention for MIL aggregation, optimizing feature representations and attention weights with separate computational graphs for stable training.

Result: Outperforms benchmarks in mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma.

Conclusion: TAPFM enables practical adaptation of PFMs for clinical applications on standard hardware.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs
for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,
necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI
analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask
\textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer
(\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature
representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate
computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training
dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end
adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung
adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently
outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the
benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable
mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs
practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

*Yake Wei, Yu Miao, Dongzhan Zhou, Di Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MokA is a multimodal-aware fine-tuning strategy addressing limitations of current methods by focusing on unimodal and cross-modal adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current efficient multimodal fine-tuning methods, borrowed from LLMs, neglect multimodal differences, hindering full modality utilization.

Method: Proposes Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), compressing unimodal information with modality-specific parameters and enhancing cross-modal interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments across multimodal scenarios and LLM backbones show consistent improvements, validating MokA's efficacy.

Conclusion: MokA offers a targeted solution for efficient MLLM adaptation, encouraging further exploration.

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning
methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,
often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even
affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical
observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are
two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this
perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a
multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal
characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by
modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal
interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive
experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,
visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,
Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility
of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also
conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more
targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further
exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

### [263] [Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05341)
*Xingjian Ran, Yixuan Li, Linning Xu, Mulin Yu, Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DirectLayout is a framework for generating 3D indoor scenes from text using LLMs, addressing layout generation challenges with spatial reasoning and iterative alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D layout generation either overfit to datasets or lack flexibility, failing to align with fine-grained user instructions.

Method: DirectLayout uses LLMs for spatial reasoning, decomposing generation into BEV layout, 3D lifting, and refinement, with CoT Activation and CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward.

Result: DirectLayout achieves high semantic consistency, generalization, and physical plausibility in experiments.

Conclusion: DirectLayout effectively generates open-vocabulary 3D layouts aligned with user instructions, advancing scene synthesis.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

TL;DR: A vision-aided autonomous reflector system enhances mmWave communication in NLoS conditions by dynamically steering signals using a motorized metallic plate, achieving a 23 dB gain in signal strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable mmWave communication in NLoS conditions is challenging, especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments.

Method: The system uses a monocular camera to detect ArUco markers, estimates angles of arrival, and aligns a reflector in real time for optimal signal redirection.

Result: Experimental results show a 23 dB average gain in signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining reception above -65 dB.

Conclusion: The system offers resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in complex environments.

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations,
especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents
a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link
performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized
metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect
ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles
of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal
redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only
authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended
signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external
infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB
average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining
signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment,
far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate
the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in
complex and dynamic environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task called omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES) and proposes a framework (RAS) to enhance segmentation models with multimodal interactions for better semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image segmentation models lack comprehensive semantic understanding for complex vision-language queries, limiting their effectiveness in user-friendly applications.

Method: The authors propose the RAS framework, which integrates a mask-centric large multimodal model to handle arbitrary prompts (text or text plus visual entities).

Result: RAS demonstrates superior performance on ORES, as well as classic and generalized referring expression segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in multimodal segmentation, offering improved interaction and comprehension for complex queries.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

*Yuxin Wen, Yangsibo Huang, Tom Goldstein, Ravi Kumar, Badih Ghazi, Chiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies cross-modality memorization in vision-language models, revealing a gap in information transfer between modalities and proposing a baseline mitigation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural network memorization, especially in multimodal contexts, addressing unintentional memorization and effective knowledge acquisition.

Method: Introduces a synthetic persona dataset, quantifies memorization and transferability by training on one modality and testing on another.

Result: Facts transfer between modalities but with a significant gap; this gap persists across scenarios like capable models and unlearning.

Conclusion: Proposes a baseline method to mitigate the gap, aiming to inspire robust multimodal learning techniques.

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

*Yani Zhang, Dongming Wu, Hao Shi, Yingfei Liu, Tiancai Wang, Haoqiang Fan, Xingping Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEGround, a novel method for embodied 3D grounding, outperforms existing models by leveraging detection and grounding queries, achieving 7.52% higher accuracy than BIP3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether embodied 3D grounding benefits from detection models, finding that even untrained detection models outperform language-trained grounding models, highlighting unresolved challenges in category-level grounding.

Method: DEGround integrates DETR queries for detection and grounding, adding a regional activation module and query-wise modulation to enhance context-aware understanding of instructions.

Result: DEGround achieves a 7.52% higher overall accuracy than BIP3D on the EmbodiedScan validation set.

Conclusion: DEGround demonstrates superior performance by combining detection and grounding, addressing limitations in current methods and advancing fine-grained context-aware grounding.

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

TL;DR: OGGSplat is a method for semantic-aware 3D scene reconstruction from sparse views, using open Gaussians and RGB-semantic inpainting for improved field-of-view expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and generalizable 3D scene reconstruction from sparse views, driven by applications like virtual reality and embodied AI.

Method: OGGSplat uses open Gaussians for semantic priors, an RGB-semantic inpainting module, and bidirectional control between diffusion models to optimize Gaussian parameters.

Result: The method achieves semantic consistency and visual plausibility, validated on a Gaussian Outpainting benchmark and real smartphone images.

Conclusion: OGGSplat offers a promising solution for semantic-aware 3D reconstruction from sparse views, with applications in emerging technologies.

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging
yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging
applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene
optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational
costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions
outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open
Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D
reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open
Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic
consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are
initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent
inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces
bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion
model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient
and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we
establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and
generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also
demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when
provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Follow-Your-Motion, a two-stage video motion transfer framework using spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to improve motion consistency and tuning efficiency in large video diffusion transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion-transfer methods suffer from motion inconsistency and inefficiency due to spatial-temporal coupling in 3D attention operators and time-consuming fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA for decoupling attention architecture and introduces sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE for faster tuning.

Result: Extensive evaluations on MotionBench demonstrate the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion in handling diverse motion types.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Motion addresses key limitations of existing methods, offering efficient and consistent motion transfer for video diffusion transformers.

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown
remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the
motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations
(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing
adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and
tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive
two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between
generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the
3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning
processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose
Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that
finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex
motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple
the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion
processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion
sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack
of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single
object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show
extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of
Follow-Your-Motion.

Motivation: Address the scarcity of well-annotated long videos for training Video-LMMs by providing a comprehensive dataset and model.

Method: Develop VideoMarathon dataset (3.3M QA pairs, 9,700 hours) and Hour-LLaVA model with memory augmentation for hour-long video processing.

Result: Hour-LLaVA outperforms on long video benchmarks, showcasing dataset quality and model effectiveness.

Conclusion: VideoMarathon and Hour-LLaVA advance long video understanding, setting new benchmarks for Video-LMMs.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSG-World is an end-to-end framework for 3D Gaussian world modeling using dual state observations to address occlusion issues and improve reconstruction stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world modeling methods lack 3D or physical consistency (implicit models) or require multi-stage processing (explicit models). Dual state observations can mitigate occlusion problems.

Method: DSG-World constructs dual segmentation-aware Gaussian fields, enforces photometric and semantic consistency, and uses pseudo intermediate states and co-pruning for refinement.

Result: The framework achieves efficient real-to-simulation transfer, high-fidelity rendering, and object-level manipulation without dense observations or multi-stage pipelines.

Conclusion: DSG-World demonstrates strong generalization for novel views and scene states, proving effective for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited
observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing
world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are
hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,
explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage
processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to
occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same
scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer
complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions
and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present
DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D
Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual
segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and
semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for
symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine
geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer
purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity
rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense
observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness
of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

*Zhang Li, Yuliang Liu, Qiang Liu, Zhiyin Ma, Ziyang Zhang, Shuo Zhang, Zidun Guo, Jiarui Zhang, Xinyu Wang, Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR introduces a vision-language model for document parsing using the SRR triplet paradigm, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve document parsing by avoiding complex multi-tool pipelines and inefficient large models.

Method: Uses the Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm to decompose parsing into layout analysis, content identification, and logical ordering.

Result: Outperforms MinerU by 5.1% on average, excels in handling formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%), and processes pages faster (0.84 pages/sec).

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR achieves state-of-the-art performance with a smaller 3B-parameter model, enabling efficient deployment on a single GPU.

Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that
advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation
(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a
complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the
inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,
large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted
into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?"
(recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout
analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused
decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable
processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,
we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to
date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both
Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an
average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content
such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter
model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL
(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on
English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page
documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for
MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed
for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at
https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR.

*Jianghao Wu, Yicheng Wu, Yutong Xie, Wenjia Bai, You Zhang, Feilong Tang, Yulong Li, Yasmeen George, Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-TTA improves medical image segmentation by adapting SAM at test-time, addressing input and semantic discrepancies without losing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's limited adaptability to medical domains and reduced generalization in existing adaptations like MedSAM.

Method: Proposes SAM-TTA with SBCT for input adaptation and DUMT for semantic alignment via consistency learning.

Result: Outperforms existing TTA methods and MedSAM in some cases across five datasets.

Conclusion: SAM-TTA sets a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation, preserving SAM's generalization while enhancing performance.

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains.
Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical
imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a
fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while
improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time
framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies
caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images
and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object
definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.
ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)
Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively
converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs
while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between
medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher
adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal
representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without
auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five
public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA
approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain
scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image
segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

*Zhiyun Deng, Dongmyeong Lee, Amanda Adkins, Jesse Quattrociocchi, Christian Ellis, Joydeep Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoViX is a self-supervised framework for robust 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments, addressing perceptual ambiguities and seasonal shifts by learning invariant representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in GPS-denied, off-road localization include perceptual ambiguities and seasonal appearance shifts, which hinder alignment with outdated satellite imagery.

Method: MoViX uses pose-dependent positive sampling, hard negative mining, motion-informed frame sampling, and temporal aggregation to learn viewpoint- and season-invariant representations. It integrates with Monte Carlo Localization for inference.

Result: On the TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, MoViX achieves 93% localization within 25 meters and 100% within 50 meters, outperforming baselines without environment-specific tuning.

Conclusion: MoViX demonstrates robust, generalizable localization in challenging environments, even with outdated satellite imagery and minimal training data.

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments
remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive
vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly
alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To
address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video
localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant
representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate
localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to
enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining
to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame
sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator
emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous
ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,
using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.
Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and
confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the
TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over
12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters
of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in
unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a
real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a
different robot platform.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LeanPO is a reference-free method to optimize Video-LLMs by reformulating rewards and using self-generated preference data, mitigating unintended likelihood drops and improving alignment with human trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference alignment techniques in Video-LLMs, like DPO, inadvertently decrease the likelihood of target responses, worsening with video complexity.

Method: Proposes LeanPO, which reformulates rewards as average likelihood and uses a self-generated preference data pipeline with dynamic label smoothing.

Result: LeanPO significantly enhances Video-LLM performance, boosting baselines with minimal training overhead and improving alignment with human trustworthiness.

Conclusion: LeanPO provides a simple, effective solution for reliable and efficient Video-LLMs by addressing unintended likelihood drops and noise in video content.

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment
techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin
between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the
likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta
(y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training,
inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this
paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,
showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video
content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean
Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates
the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to
the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness
correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses
relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the
preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain
high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus
mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label
smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse
video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the
performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of
varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO
offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with
human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient
Video-LLMs.

### [277] [Can Foundation Models Generalise the Presentation Attack Detection Capabilities on ID Cards?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05263)
*Juan E. Tapia, Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Foundation Models (FM) to improve generalization in Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) for ID cards across diverse countries, addressing limitations of current systems trained on limited datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PAD systems lack generalization due to privacy constraints limiting training data. FM trained on large datasets offer potential for better performance.

Method: The study benchmarks FM capabilities using zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches on two datasets: a private Chilean ID dataset and an open-set with IDs from Finland, Spain, and Slovakia.

Result: Findings show that bona fide (genuine) images are crucial for achieving generalization in PAD.

Conclusion: FM can enhance PAD generalization, with bona fide images playing a key role.

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD)
on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of
countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two,
or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they
do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an
unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained
on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work
intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to
adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were
used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.
One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID
countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide
images are the key to generalisation.

*Animesh Gupta, Jay Parmar, Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave, Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TF-CoVR introduces a benchmark for temporally fine-grained Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR), focusing on gymnastics and diving, with 180K triplets. It proposes TF-CoVR-Base, a two-stage training framework, improving retrieval performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoVR benchmarks lack focus on subtle, fast-paced temporal differences, limiting practical usefulness. TF-CoVR addresses this gap.

Method: TF-CoVR-Base involves pre-training a video encoder for fine-grained action classification and aligning queries with videos using contrastive learning.

Result: TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 to 7.51 and fine-tuned state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

Conclusion: TF-CoVR advances CoVR by addressing temporal granularity, offering a practical benchmark and effective framework.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video
and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR
benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do
not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We
introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally
fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K
triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing
on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the
same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct
each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences
between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with
multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such
as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose
TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video
encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally
discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos
using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,
video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained
composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR,
TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and
after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-scale bilateral grid to unify appearance codes and bilateral grids, improving geometric accuracy in dynamic scene reconstruction for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios often lack perfect photometric consistency, and existing methods (appearance codes, bilateral grids) have limitations in modeling capability or optimization.

Method: Proposes a novel multi-scale bilateral grid combining appearance codes and bilateral grids for pixel-wise color mapping.

Result: Outperforms appearance codes and bilateral grids in geometric accuracy, reducing floaters caused by photometric inconsistency across four datasets.

Conclusion: The multi-scale bilateral grid is effective for dynamic scene reconstruction, crucial for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely
on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric
consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to
address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code
is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to
perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain
effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that
unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous
driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral
grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is
important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results
across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further
demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale
bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric
inconsistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework improves long-term consistency in video world models using geometry-grounded spatial memory, outperforming baselines in quality and context length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with scene consistency due to limited temporal context, leading to forgetting. Inspired by human memory, the paper aims to enhance long-term consistency.

Method: Introduces a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory framework with mechanisms for storing and retrieving information. Custom datasets are used for training and evaluation.

Result: The framework shows improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The approach paves the way for long-term consistent world generation in video models.

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

TL;DR: RaySt3R recasts 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem, using a transformer to predict depth maps and masks from query rays, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D shape completion methods lack consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle with sharp boundaries.

Method: Uses a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object masks, and confidence scores for query rays from a single RGB-D image, fusing predictions across views.

Result: Outperforms baselines by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RaySt3R effectively addresses limitations of current methods, offering improved performance and consistency in 3D shape completion.

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin
reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D
object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods
lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture
sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by
recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,
given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of
query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object
masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses
these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D
shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe
it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all
datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision Concept Transformer (VCT) and Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) to address limitations of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) in medical AI, improving interpretability and faithfulness under perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CBMs in medical AI lack utility due to reliance on concept features alone and suffer from performance drops and unstable explanations under perturbations.

Method: Proposes VCT and SVCT, which fuse concept and image features using a vision transformer backbone and incorporate Denoised Diffusion Smoothing for stability.

Result: VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy and interpretability on four medical datasets, with SVCT providing faithful explanations even under perturbations.

Conclusion: SVCT meets medical field needs by balancing interpretability, accuracy, and robustness, addressing CBM limitations.

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for embodied cognition focus on static scenes, neglecting dynamic interactions. EOC-Bench aims to fill this gap by assessing object understanding in dynamic environments.

Method: EOC-Bench includes 3,277 annotated QA pairs across three temporal categories (Past, Present, Future), 11 evaluation dimensions, and 3 visual referencing types. A mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework and a multi-scale temporal accuracy metric are developed.

Result: The benchmark evaluates various MLLMs, providing insights into their embodied object cognitive capabilities.

Conclusion: EOC-Bench advances MLLMs' embodied cognition, serving as a foundation for reliable core models in embodied systems.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate
persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with
tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied
benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's
appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic
changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce
EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate
object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially,
EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three
temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained
evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough
assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework
with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy
metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct
comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level
MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object
cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for
developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

TL;DR: AliTok, a novel Aligned Tokenizer, improves autoregressive image generation by ensuring unidirectional dependencies among tokens, enhancing reconstruction and generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenizers create bidirectional dependencies, which conflict with autoregressive models' unidirectional nature, hindering effective modeling.

Method: AliTok uses a causal decoder for unidirectional token dependencies, prefix tokens, and two-stage training to improve reconstruction consistency.

Result: On ImageNet-256, AliTok achieves gFID scores of 1.50 (177M params) and 1.35 (662M params), outperforming diffusion methods with faster sampling.

Conclusion: AliTok aligns tokenizer and autoregressive model approaches, achieving superior performance and efficiency in image generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on
previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with
bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the
effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel
Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish
unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token
modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore,
by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to
enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction
performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a
standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M
parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the
parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35,
surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling
speed. The code and weights are available at

TL;DR: SeedVR2 is a one-step diffusion-based video restoration model that improves efficiency and performance for high-resolution videos using adaptive window attention and enhanced training losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based VR methods are computationally expensive, and extending distillation-based approaches to high-resolution VR is challenging.

Method: SeedVR2 uses adaptive window attention and adversarial training with real data, incorporating feature matching loss and other enhancements.

Result: SeedVR2 achieves comparable or better performance than existing VR methods in a single step.

Conclusion: The proposed SeedVR2 model efficiently addresses high-resolution VR challenges with improved architecture and training techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate
significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive
computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.

Motivation: To enhance region-level visual understanding by integrating segmentation and semantic generation in a lightweight, efficient manner.

Method: Extends SAM 2 with LLMs, introduces Semantic Perceiver, and uses a refined dataset of 1.5M images and 0.6M videos.

Result: PAM runs 1.2-2.4x faster with less GPU memory, excelling in diverse region understanding tasks.

Conclusion: PAM is a practical, efficient baseline for future region-level visual understanding research.

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and

by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object
segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs,
including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed

transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision,
localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM
comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also
develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a
high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations,
including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for
lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance
across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster
and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical
solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach
will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual
understanding.

*Olaf Dünkel, Thomas Wimmer, Christian Theobalt, Christian Rupprecht, Adam Kortylewski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D-aware pseudo-labeling method to improve semantic correspondence estimation, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced annotation needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing ambiguities in semantic matching for symmetric objects or repeated parts using large pre-trained vision models.

Method: Training an adapter to refine features with 3D-aware pseudo-labels, using chaining, relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D spherical prototype constraints.

Result: Achieves a 4% absolute gain on SPair-71k and 7% improvement over similarly supervised methods.

Conclusion: The method simplifies training extension to other data sources and reduces annotation dependency.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARBLE is a method for material editing in images using CLIP-space embeddings and pre-trained text-to-image models, enabling fine-grained control over material attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve exemplar-based material editing by leveraging CLIP-space embeddings and pre-trained models for better control and blending of materials.

Method: Uses CLIP-space embeddings to find material directions, controls pre-trained text-to-image models, and employs a shallow network for parametric control over material attributes.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative analysis shows effective material blending and fine-grained attribute control, with support for multiple edits in a single pass.

Conclusion: MARBLE advances material editing by enabling precise control and blending, applicable to painting and other creative tasks.

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active
area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method
for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material
properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to
control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material
editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material
attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the
CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric
control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic,
transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the
desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative
analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present
the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass
and applicability to painting.

*Daniel Rho, Jun Myeong Choi, Biswadip Dey, Roni Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProJo4D is a progressive joint optimization framework for 4D scene understanding, outperforming prior methods in future state prediction, novel view rendering, and material estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating physics from visual data face challenges like error accumulation and impractical input requirements, limiting their real-world scalability.

Method: ProJo4D progressively optimizes geometry, appearance, physical state, and material properties jointly, guided by parameter sensitivity.

Result: ProJo4D outperforms prior work on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets in 4D future state prediction, novel view rendering, and material parameter estimation.

Conclusion: ProJo4D effectively addresses the challenges of physically grounded 4D scene understanding, offering improved performance and scalability.

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel
view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new
applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,
however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications
like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing
methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically
require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,
real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential
optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error
accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material
parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,
directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the
highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We
propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually
increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,
leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,
and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show
that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view
rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding. For demos, please

### [290] [Does Your 3D Encoder Really Work? When Pretrain-SFT from 2D VLMs Meets 3D VLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05318)
*Haoyuan Li, Yanpeng Zhou, Yufei Gao, Tao Tang, Jianhua Han, Yujie Yuan, Dave Zhenyu Chen, Jiawang Bian, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 3D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), identifying performance gaps in 3D scene-centric approaches due to limited reliance on 3D encoders and ineffective pre-training. It introduces a new dataset to improve 3D understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why 3D scene-centric VLMs underperform compared to 3D object-centric and 2D image-based approaches, and to enhance genuine 3D scene understanding.

Method: Categorizes 3D VLMs by encoder design, analyzes performance gaps, and introduces a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset to disrupt shortcuts and improve 3D understanding.

Result: 3D scene-centric VLMs rely less on 3D encoders, pre-training is less effective, and data scaling benefits are limited. The new dataset aims to address these issues.

Conclusion: Advanced evaluation and improved strategies are needed for better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest
in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense
Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images
through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,
allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this
paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D
scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D
scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively
lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based
approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing
that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and
the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we
observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our
investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment
capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent
answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D
encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene
understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset
designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for
better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

*Duochao Shi, Weijie Wang, Donny Y. Chen, Zeyu Zhang, Jia-Wang Bian, Bohan Zhuang, Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PM-Loss, a regularization loss using a pointmap from a pre-trained transformer, improves depth map quality in 3DGS by addressing depth discontinuities, leading to better rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth discontinuities at object boundaries cause fragmented point clouds in 3DGS, degrading rendering quality.

Method: Introduces PM-Loss, leveraging a pointmap from a pre-trained transformer to regularize depth maps, enhancing geometric smoothness.

Result: Improved depth maps lead to better rendering in 3DGS across architectures and scenes.

Conclusion: PM-Loss effectively mitigates depth discontinuity issues, enhancing 3DGS performance.

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis.
This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known
camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities
at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading
rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To
tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a
pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself
may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric
smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map,
our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various
architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results. Our

TL;DR: CG-AV-Counting is a new benchmark for video counting tasks, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks. AV-Reasoner, a model using GRPO and curriculum learning, achieves SOTA results but struggles with out-of-domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs perform poorly on counting tasks due to limited benchmarks (short videos, close-set queries, lack of clues). CG-AV-Counting aims to fill this gap.

Method: Introduces CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated benchmark with 1,027 questions and 5,845 clues. Proposes AV-Reasoner, trained with GRPO and curriculum learning.

Result: AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results but fails to generalize on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: CG-AV-Counting is a comprehensive benchmark, and AV-Reasoner shows promise but has limitations in generalization.

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting
tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack
of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce
CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with
1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It
supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive
testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to
improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained
with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related
tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However,
experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language
space fails to bring performance gains. The code and benchmark have been

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINT-CoT enhances multimodal math reasoning by interleaving visual tokens into textual CoT, outperforming baselines on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to multimodal domains for math problem-solving faces limitations like coarse visual regions and weak vision encoder perception.

Method: Proposes MINT-CoT, which dynamically interleaves visual tokens into CoT steps using an Interleave Token, supported by a dataset and three-stage training.

Result: MINT-CoT-7B outperforms baselines by +34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar.

Conclusion: MINT-CoT effectively integrates visual and textual reasoning for math problems, validated by strong benchmark performance.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to
multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for
image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.
However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on
coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders
on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual
modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical
INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively
interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an
Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within
math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,
containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual
regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.
We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively
combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which
derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in
mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by
+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively. Our

*Ghazi Shazan Ahmad, Ahmed Heakl, Hanan Gani, Abdelrahman Shaker, Zhiqiang Shen, Ranjay Krishna, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMolmo is a multimodal model for spatio-temporal localization, combining LLM reasoning with temporal consistency and mask fusion for improved accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based approaches lack contextual understanding and generalization, which VideoMolmo addresses by integrating large language models and temporal modules.

Method: VideoMolmo uses a temporal module with attention for frame consistency and a mask fusion pipeline for bidirectional point propagation. It decomposes tasks into LLM-generated coordinates and sequential mask fusion.

Result: VideoMolmo outperforms existing models in spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning, validated on a curated dataset and VPoS-Bench.

Conclusion: VideoMolmo enhances spatio-temporal localization and reasoning, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse
domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive
interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack
the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting
their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a
large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing
conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,
VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to
condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.
Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for
bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video
sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate
precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module
to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language
model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,
we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated
with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we
introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five
real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,
Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring
Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to
existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing
accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available
at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/VideoMolmo.

TL;DR: A pipeline for creating defurnished indoor spaces using textured meshes and multi-view panoramas, leveraging segmentation, plane extension, and ControlNet inpainting for high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generate accurate and high-quality defurnished replicas of indoor spaces, addressing limitations of existing methods like blurry outputs from neural radiance fields or hallucinations in RGB-D inpainting.

Method: 1. Segment and remove furniture from mesh to create a Simplified Defurnished Mesh (SDM). 2. Extract Canny edges from SDM-rendered depth/normal images. 3. Use ControlNet inpainting guided by these edges to remove furniture from panoramas. 4. Texture the mesh with inpainted panoramas.

Result: Produces higher-quality defurnished assets compared to neural radiance fields (blurry) or RGB-D inpainting (hallucinations).

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively generates defurnished indoor spaces with superior quality by combining geometric guidance from SDM and ControlNet inpainting.

Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces
represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images.
To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh
representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified
defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying
structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth
and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove
the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control
signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be
hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The
inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach
produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance
fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D
inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

Conclusion: ContentV demonstrates efficient, high-quality video generation with innovations in architecture, training, and feedback.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation demand increasingly efficient training

ContentV, an 8B-parameter text-to-video model that achieves state-of-the-art
performance (85.14 on VBench) after training on 256 x 64GB Neural Processing
Units (NPUs) for merely four weeks. ContentV generates diverse, high-quality

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Visual Commonsense Dataset (VCD), a large-scale dataset with 100K images and 14M object-commonsense pairs, bridging the gap between commonsense knowledge and visual grounding. It proposes a three-level taxonomy for visual commonsense and a generative model (VCM) to demonstrate its utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing commonsense knowledge bases lack visually grounded representations, and scene graph datasets focus on observable information without systematic commonsense categorization. VCD aims to address this gap.

Method: VCD introduces a three-level taxonomy for visual commonsense (Property, Action, Space) and represents commonsense as triples grounded in object bounding boxes. The VCM model combines vision-language models with instruction tuning to generate visual commonsense.

Result: VCD is shown to be high-quality and valuable for advancing visually grounded commonsense understanding. The VCM model effectively leverages the dataset.

Conclusion: VCD fills a critical gap in visual commonsense representation, and its utility is demonstrated through VCM. The dataset and code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Visual commonsense plays a vital role in understanding and reasoning about
the visual world. While commonsense knowledge bases like ConceptNet provide
structured collections of general facts, they lack visually grounded
representations. Scene graph datasets like Visual Genome, though rich in
object-level descriptions, primarily focus on directly observable information
and lack systematic categorization of commonsense knowledge. We present Visual
Commonsense Dataset (VCD), a large-scale dataset containing over 100,000 images
and 14 million object-commonsense pairs that bridges this gap. VCD introduces a
novel three-level taxonomy for visual commonsense, integrating both Seen
(directly observable) and Unseen (inferrable) commonsense across Property,
Action, and Space aspects. Each commonsense is represented as a triple where
the head entity is grounded to object bounding boxes in images, enabling
scene-dependent and object-specific visual commonsense representation. To
demonstrate VCD's utility, we develop VCM, a generative model that combines a
vision-language model with instruction tuning to discover diverse visual
commonsense from images. Extensive evaluations demonstrate both the high
quality of VCD and its value as a resource for advancing visually grounded
commonsense understanding and reasoning. Our dataset and code will be released
on https://github.com/NUSTM/VCD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reveals that only a small subset of attention heads in MLLMs actively contribute to visual understanding. It introduces SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy, to accelerate inference while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how MLLMs process visual inputs and leverage the sparsity of active attention heads for efficiency.

Method: A training-free framework identifies visual heads, followed by SparseMM, which allocates asymmetric computation budgets based on visual relevance.

Result: SparseMM achieves 1.38x acceleration, 52% memory reduction, and maintains performance parity.

Conclusion: The sparsity of visual heads can be exploited for efficient MLLM inference, demonstrated by SparseMM's superior trade-offs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this
work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their
attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small
subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively
contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these
heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies
head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on
this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that
allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual
scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference
of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the
particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual
semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%
memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on
efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at

TL;DR: A system for neural inverse rendering from multi-view videos of light propagation, using time-resolved neural radiance caching for accurate light transport effects and 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in capturing and reconstructing 3D scenes with strong indirect light, enabling advanced applications like view synthesis and relighting.

Method: Extends neural radiance caching with time resolution, applied to flash lidar measurements for direct and indirect light transport modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction, view synthesis, and decomposition of light into direct/indirect components.

Conclusion: The system advances inverse rendering capabilities, offering novel tools for scene analysis and manipulation.

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering
from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a
time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that
accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at
any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for
direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured
measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we
demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of
captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel
capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeTimeGS introduces a flexible 4D representation for dynamic 3D scenes, improving rendering quality over methods using canonical Gaussian primitives and deformation fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex motions due to deformation field optimization challenges.

Method: Proposes FreeTimeGS, a 4D representation allowing Gaussian primitives at arbitrary time/locations, each with a motion function.

Result: Outperforms recent methods in rendering quality on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FreeTimeGS offers superior flexibility and performance for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with
complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the
canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to
observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these
methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the
difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we
propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives
to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian
primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving
the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian
primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions
over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on
several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms
recent methods by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMathQA is a benchmark for evaluating models' ability to perform cross-modal, temporally extended mathematical reasoning in videos, covering diverse domains and real-world challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning in videos is complex due to multimodal, non-linear, and noisy content. Existing approaches lack evaluation frameworks for such scenarios.

Method: The benchmark includes 10 mathematical domains, videos of varying lengths, and questions requiring direct problem solving, conceptual transfer, and deep instructional comprehension. Graduate-level experts annotated the data.

Result: The benchmark provides a high-quality dataset with multi-step reasoning annotations, highlighting limitations of current models.

Conclusion: VideoMathQA establishes a systematic framework for evaluating models' reasoning abilities in multimodal, temporally extended mathematical problem settings.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code

### [302] [Detection-Driven Object Count Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11721)
*Oz Zafar, Yuval Cohen, Lior Wolf, Idan Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework improves object count control in text-to-image generation by leveraging pre-trained counting models and detectors, addressing challenges like noise robustness, viewpoint changes, and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate object count control in text-to-image generation is challenging due to limited training data, iterative processes, and robustness issues in existing methods.

Method: The framework optimizes a counting token using outer-loop loss, introduces detection-driven scaling for error correction, and reuses optimized parameters for efficiency.

Result: The method enhances efficiency, flexibility, and accuracy in counting across diverse object categories without repeated optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key challenges in object count control, offering improved performance and practicality.

Abstract: Accurately controlling object count in text-to-image generation remains a key
challenge. Supervised methods often fail, as training data rarely covers all
count variations. Methods that manipulate the denoising process to add or
remove objects can help; however, they still require labeled data, limit
robustness and image quality, and rely on a slow, iterative process.
  Pre-trained differentiable counting models that rely on soft object density
summation exist and could steer generation, but employing them presents three
main challenges: (i) they are pre-trained on clean images, making them less
effective during denoising steps that operate on noisy inputs; (ii) they are
not robust to viewpoint changes; and (iii) optimization is computationally
expensive, requiring repeated model evaluations per image.
  We propose a new framework that uses pre-trained object counting techniques
and object detectors to guide generation. First, we optimize a counting token
using an outer-loop loss computed on fully generated images. Second, we
introduce a detection-driven scaling term that corrects errors caused by
viewpoint and proportion shifts, among other factors, without requiring
backpropagation through the detection model. Third, we show that the optimized
parameters can be reused for new prompts, removing the need for repeated
optimization. Our method provides efficiency through token reuse, flexibility
via compatibility with various detectors, and accuracy with improved counting
across diverse object categories.

### [303] [Contrastive Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05350)
*George Stoica, Vivek Ramanujan, Xiang Fan, Ali Farhadi, Ranjay Krishna, Judy Hoffman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Contrastive Flow Matching enhances conditional flow uniqueness in diffusion models, improving training speed, reducing de-noising steps, and lowering FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ambiguity in conditional flow-matching by ensuring uniqueness across flows for better condition separation.

Method: Introduces a contrastive objective to maximize dissimilarities between flows from arbitrary sample pairs.

Result: Achieves up to 9x faster training, 5x fewer de-noising steps, and 8.9 lower FID compared to standard flow matching.

Conclusion: Contrastive Flow Matching effectively improves conditional generation in diffusion models.

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from
a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows
between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g.,
class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from
different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We
introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching
objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows,
enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that
maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.
We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments
across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and
text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with
Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x,
(2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9
compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code
at: https://github.com/gstoica27/DeltaFM.git.

### [304] [Diff-Instruct++: Training One-step Text-to-image Generator Model to Align with Human Preferences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18881)
*Weijian Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diff-Instruct++ (DI++), a fast-converging, data-free method for aligning one-step text-to-image generators with human preferences, outperforming other models in aesthetic and preference scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning one-step text-to-image generators with human preferences, inspired by RLHF, to improve generation quality and user satisfaction.

Method: Formulates alignment as maximizing human reward functions with a Kullback-Leibler divergence term, introducing DI++ for efficient alignment without image data.

Result: DI++ achieves strong scores (Aesthetic: 6.19, Image Reward: 1.24, HPSv2.0: 28.48) on COCO, outperforming models like Stable Diffusion XL and PixelArt-α.

Conclusion: DI++ is an effective human-preference alignment method for one-step text-to-image models, with theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: One-step text-to-image generator models offer advantages such as swift
inference efficiency, flexible architectures, and state-of-the-art generation
performance. In this paper, we study the problem of aligning one-step generator
models with human preferences for the first time. Inspired by the success of
reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), we formulate the alignment
problem as maximizing expected human reward functions while adding an Integral
Kullback-Leibler divergence term to prevent the generator from diverging. By
overcoming technical challenges, we introduce Diff-Instruct++ (DI++), the
first, fast-converging and image data-free human preference alignment method
for one-step text-to-image generators. We also introduce novel theoretical
insights, showing that using CFG for diffusion distillation is secretly doing
RLHF with DI++. Such an interesting finding brings understanding and potential
contributions to future research involving CFG. In the experiment sections, we
align both UNet-based and DiT-based one-step generators using DI++, which use
the Stable Diffusion 1.5 and the PixelArt-$\alpha$ as the reference diffusion
processes. The resulting DiT-based one-step text-to-image model achieves a
strong Aesthetic Score of 6.19 and an Image Reward of 1.24 on the COCO
validation prompt dataset. It also achieves a leading Human preference Score
(HPSv2.0) of 28.48, outperforming other open-sourced models such as Stable
Diffusion XL, DMD2, SD-Turbo, as well as PixelArt-$\alpha$. Both theoretical
contributions and empirical evidence indicate that DI++ is a strong
human-preference alignment approach for one-step text-to-image models. The

### [305] [ViewFusion: Learning Composable Diffusion Models for Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02906)
*Bernard Spiegl, Andrea Perin, Stéphane Deny, Alexander Ilin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViewFusion is a flexible, end-to-end generative method for novel view synthesis, combining diffusion denoising with adaptive pixel-weighting for high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of existing novel view synthesis methods, such as lack of generalization, fixed input requirements, and poor performance in underdetermined conditions.

Method: Simultaneously applies diffusion denoising to multiple input views, combines noise gradients with inferred pixel-weighting masks, and adapts to variable input views.

Result: Generates high-quality views, generalizes across scenes and classes, handles variable input views, and performs well in underdetermined conditions.

Conclusion: ViewFusion offers unparalleled flexibility and quality but lacks 3D scene embedding and has slow inference speed.

Abstract: Deep learning is providing a wealth of new approaches to the problem of novel
view synthesis, from Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) based approaches to
end-to-end style architectures. Each approach offers specific strengths but
also comes with limitations in their applicability. This work introduces
ViewFusion, an end-to-end generative approach to novel view synthesis with
unparalleled flexibility. ViewFusion consists in simultaneously applying a
diffusion denoising step to any number of input views of a scene, then
combining the noise gradients obtained for each view with an (inferred)
pixel-weighting mask, ensuring that for each region of the target view only the
most informative input views are taken into account. Our approach resolves
several limitations of previous approaches by (1) being trainable and
generalizing across multiple scenes and object classes, (2) adaptively taking
in a variable number of pose-free views at both train and test time, (3)
generating plausible views even in severely underdetermined conditions (thanks
to its generative nature) -- all while generating views of quality on par or
even better than comparable methods. Limitations include not generating a 3D
embedding of the scene, resulting in a relatively slow inference speed, and our
method only being tested on the relatively small Neural 3D Mesh Renderer
dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/bronemos/view-fusion.

*Haoran Zhang, Aparna Balagopalan, Nassim Oufattole, Hyewon Jeong, Yan Wu, Jiacheng Zhu, Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEMoN is a method to detect label errors in image-caption datasets, improving downstream model performance by filtering noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy image-caption pairs in web-scraped datasets harm model reliability, but existing methods lack effectiveness.

Method: LEMoN uses multimodal neighborhood analysis in latent space of pretrained models to identify label errors.

Result: LEMoN outperforms baselines by 3% in error detection and boosts downstream captioning by 2 BLEU points.

Conclusion: LEMoN effectively filters noisy data, enhancing model training and performance.

Abstract: Large repositories of image-caption pairs are essential for the development
of vision-language models. However, these datasets are often extracted from
noisy data scraped from the web, and contain many mislabeled instances. In
order to improve the reliability of downstream models, it is important to
identify and filter images with incorrect captions. However, beyond filtering
based on image-caption embedding similarity, no prior works have proposed other
methods to filter noisy multimodal data, or concretely assessed the impact of
noisy captioning data on downstream training. In this work, we propose,
theoretically justify, and empirically validate LEMoN, a method to identify
label errors in image-caption datasets. Our method leverages the multimodal
neighborhood of image-caption pairs in the latent space of contrastively
pretrained multimodal models to automatically identify label errors. Through
empirical evaluations across eight datasets and twelve baselines, we find that
LEMoN outperforms the baselines by over 3% in label error detection, and that
training on datasets filtered using our method improves downstream captioning
performance by more than 2 BLEU points over noisy training.

*Carlos Penarrubia, Jose J. Valero-Mas, Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper consolidates Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in Text Recognition (TR), reviewing methods, comparing results, and addressing inconsistencies to standardize and advance the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TR relies on labeled data, but SSL offers a solution using unlabeled data. Recent SSL methods for TR lack coordination, hindering progress.

Method: Review and analyze existing SSL methods for TR, compare results, and highlight inconsistencies in literature.

Result: Identifies gaps and inconsistencies in current SSL methods for TR, proposing standardization and new research directions.

Conclusion: The paper aims to unify SSL in TR, fostering proper development and guiding future research.

Abstract: Text Recognition (TR) refers to the research area that focuses on retrieving
textual information from images, a topic that has seen significant advancements
in the last decade due to the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However, these
solutions often necessitate vast amounts of manually labeled or synthetic data.
Addressing this challenge, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has gained attention
by utilizing large datasets of unlabeled data to train DNN, thereby generating
meaningful and robust representations. Although SSL was initially overlooked in
TR because of its unique characteristics, recent years have witnessed a surge
in the development of SSL methods specifically for this field. This rapid
development, however, has led to many methods being explored independently,
without taking previous efforts in methodology or comparison into account,
thereby hindering progress in the field of research. This paper, therefore,
seeks to consolidate the use of SSL in the field of TR, offering a critical and
comprehensive overview of the current state of the art. We will review and
analyze the existing methods, compare their results, and highlight
inconsistencies in the current literature. This thorough analysis aims to
provide general insights into the field, propose standardizations, identify new
research directions, and foster its proper development.

*Xingliang Lei, Yiwen Ye, Zhisong Wang, Ziyang Chen, Minglei Shu, Weidong Cai, Yanning Zhang, Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Target Parameter Pre-training (TPP) enhances PEFT by pre-training new parameters before fine-tuning, improving performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods ignore initialization of new parameters, relying on random initialization. TPP leverages pre-training benefits for all parameters.

Method: TPP pre-trains new parameters in an additional stage before PEFT, using a pretext task to learn downstream data representations.

Result: TPP significantly improves performance when integrated with existing PEFT methods across seven datasets and multiple modalities.

Conclusion: TPP is a versatile and effective framework for enhancing PEFT by pre-training target parameters, demonstrating broad applicability and performance gains.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged to address
overfitting and high computational costs associated with fully fine-tuning in
self-supervised learning. Mainstream PEFT methods add a few trainable
parameters while keeping the pre-trained backbone parameters fixed. These
methods achieve comparative, and often superior, performance to fully
fine-tuning, demonstrating the powerful representation ability of the
pre-trained backbone. Despite this success, these methods typically ignore the
initialization of the new parameters, often relying solely on random
initialization. We argue that if pre-training is significantly beneficial, it
should be applied to all parameters requiring representational capacity.
Motivated by this, we propose Target Parameter Pre-training (TPP), a simple yet
effective fine-tuning framework. TPP pre-trains target parameters, i.e., the
new parameters introduced during fine-tuning, in an additional stage before
PEFT. During this stage, the pre-trained backbone parameters are frozen, and
only the new parameters are trainable. A defined pretext task encourages the
new parameters to learn specific representations of downstream data.
Subsequently, when PEFT is employed, the pre-trained new parameters are loaded
to enhance fine-tuning efficiency. The proposed TPP framework is versatile,
allowing integration with various pre-trained backbones, pretext tasks, and
PEFT methods. We evaluated the fine-tuning performance of our method on seven
public datasets, covering four modalities and two task types. The results
demonstrate that TPP can be easily integrated into existing PEFT methods,
significantly improving performance.

TL;DR: DEFAME is a zero-shot MLLM pipeline for multimodal fact-checking, outperforming prior methods and GPT-4o on benchmarks, with a new dataset to avoid data leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for reliable, scalable fact-checking solutions for disinformation, especially for multimodal claims.

Method: A six-stage modular pipeline dynamically selecting tools and search depth for text-image claim verification, generating structured reports.

Result: Surpasses previous methods on VERITE, AVerITeC, and MOCHEG benchmarks and outperforms GPT-4o on the new ClaimReview2024+ dataset.

Conclusion: DEFAME sets a new state-of-the-art for multimodal fact-checking, demonstrating temporal generalizability and real-time potential.

Abstract: The proliferation of disinformation demands reliable and scalable
fact-checking solutions. We present Dynamic Evidence-based FAct-checking with
Multimodal Experts (DEFAME), a modular, zero-shot MLLM pipeline for
open-domain, text-image claim verification. DEFAME operates in a six-stage
process, dynamically selecting the tools and search depth to extract and
evaluate textual and visual evidence. Unlike prior approaches that are
text-only, lack explainability, or rely solely on parametric knowledge, DEFAME
performs end-to-end verification, accounting for images in claims and evidence
while generating structured, multimodal reports. Evaluation on the popular
benchmarks VERITE, AVerITeC, and MOCHEG shows that DEFAME surpasses all
previous methods, establishing itself as the new state-of-the-art fact-checking
system for uni- and multimodal fact-checking. Moreover, we introduce a new
multimodal benchmark, ClaimReview2024+, featuring claims after the knowledge
cutoff of GPT-4o, avoiding data leakage. Here, DEFAME drastically outperforms
the GPT-4o baselines, showing temporal generalizability and the potential for
real-time fact-checking.

TL;DR: GenLit uses Stable Video Diffusion to relight single images without explicit 3D reconstruction, achieving plausible results with minimal training on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional inverse rendering for relighting is costly and complex; leveraging video diffusion models offers a simpler alternative.

Method: GenLit distills graphics engine capabilities into a video-generation model, enabling direct light manipulation in images.

Result: The model generalizes to real-world scenes, producing convincing shadows and relighting effects.

Conclusion: Video foundation models can effectively perform relighting without explicit 3D reconstruction or ray tracing.

Abstract: Manipulating the illumination of a 3D scene within a single image represents
a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has
traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve
explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile,
recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm
could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with
networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this
paper, we exploit the physical world understanding of a video diffusion model,
particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce
GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform
light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly
insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image, and
generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned
on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling
single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows. Our results
highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information
about lighting, material, and, shape and our findings indicate that such
models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without
explicit asset reconstruction or complex ray tracing.

TL;DR: OCRBench v2 is introduced as a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LMMs' OCR capabilities, revealing limitations in challenging tasks like text localization and logical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack thorough evaluation of LMMs in challenging OCR tasks, prompting the need for OCRBench v2.

Method: OCRBench v2 includes 10,000 QA pairs, 1,500 annotated images, and diverse scenarios to test LMMs.

Result: Most LMMs score below 50/100, struggling with tasks like fine-grained perception and logical reasoning.

Conclusion: OCRBench v2 provides reliable evaluation, highlighting areas for LMM improvement in OCR tasks.

Abstract: Scoring the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) has witnessed growing interest. Existing benchmarks
have highlighted the impressive performance of LMMs in text recognition;
however, their abilities in certain challenging tasks, such as text
localization, handwritten content extraction, and logical reasoning, remain
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce OCRBench v2, a large-scale
bilingual text-centric benchmark with currently the most comprehensive set of
tasks (4x more tasks than the previous multi-scene benchmark OCRBench), the
widest coverage of scenarios (31 diverse scenarios), and thorough evaluation
metrics, with 10,000 human-verified question-answering pairs and a high
proportion of difficult samples. Moreover, we construct a private test set with
1,500 manually annotated images. The consistent evaluation trends observed
across both public and private test sets validate the OCRBench v2's
reliability. After carefully benchmarking state-of-the-art LMMs, we find that
most LMMs score below 50 (100 in total) and suffer from five-type limitations,
including less frequently encountered text recognition, fine-grained
perception, layout perception, complex element parsing, and logical reasoning.

This model has surpassed existing deep learning approaches through experimental
validation, achieving an accuracy of 98% and a sensitivity of 97%. By
overlaying sensitivity maps onto lung Computed Tomography (CT) scans, it
enables the visualization of regions most indicative of malignant or benign
classifications. This innovative method demonstrates exceptional performance in
distinguishing lung cancer with minimal false positives, thereby enhancing the
accuracy of medical diagnoses.

*Ruiyu Wang, Yu Yuan, Shizhao Sun, Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADFusion is a framework using LLMs to convert text to CAD models by alternating between sequential learning and visual feedback stages, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-CAD conversion is complex; existing methods rely on sequential signals, but CAD models are multimodal (parametric sequences and visual objects).

Method: CADFusion alternates between sequential learning (training LLMs on parametric sequences) and visual feedback (rewarding visually preferred renderings).

Result: CADFusion improves performance qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: Balancing sequential and visual signals enhances text-to-CAD conversion.

Abstract: Creating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models requires significant expertise
and effort. Text-to-CAD, which converts textual descriptions into CAD
parametric sequences, is crucial in streamlining this process. Recent studies
have utilized ground-truth parametric sequences, known as sequential signals,
as supervision to achieve this goal. However, CAD models are inherently
multimodal, comprising parametric sequences and corresponding rendered visual
objects. Besides,the rendering process from parametric sequences to visual
objects is many-to-one. Therefore, both sequential and visual signals are
critical for effective training. In this work, we introduce CADFusion, a
framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone and alternates
between two training stages: the sequential learning (SL) stage and the visual
feedback (VF) stage. In the SL stage, we train LLMs using ground-truth
parametric sequences, enabling the generation of logically coherent parametric
sequences. In the VF stage, we reward parametric sequences that render into
visually preferred objects and penalize those that do not, allowing LLMs to
learn how rendered visual objects are perceived and evaluated. These two stages
alternate throughout the training, ensuring balanced learning and preserving
benefits of both signals. Experiments demonstrate that CADFusion significantly
improves performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Peiyuan Zhang, Yongqi Chen, Runlong Su, Hangliang Ding, Ion Stoica, Zhengzhong Liu, Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sliding tile attention (STA) reduces compute costs in video diffusion models by focusing on localized 3D windows, achieving significant speedups without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the prohibitive compute cost of full 3D attention in video generation, which dominates inference time.

Method: Introduces STA, a tile-by-tile sliding window attention mechanism with hardware-aware design and kernel optimizations.

Result: STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over FlashAttention-2/3, reducing end-to-end latency from 945s to 685s (or 268s with finetuning).

Conclusion: STA provides an efficient, hardware-friendly solution for video generation, enabling faster inference without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention power state-of-the-art
video generation, but suffer from prohibitive compute cost -- when generating
just a 5-second 720P video, attention alone takes 800 out of 945 seconds of
total inference time. This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to
address this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in
pretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D
windows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA
eliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise
sliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel
hardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being
hardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the
first efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving
58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over
FlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading
video DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s
without quality degradation, requiring no training. Enabling finetuning further
lowers latency to 268s with only a 0.09% drop on VBench. We make our codebase

### [315] [Contrastive Representation Distillation via Multi-Scale Feature Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05835)
*Cuipeng Wang, Tieyuan Chen, Haipeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSDCRD is a novel contrastive representation distillation method that decouples multi-scale local features in knowledge distillation, improving student model performance across homogeneous and heterogeneous teacher-student pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods neglect decoupling interdependent local regions in global features, leading to suboptimal performance. MSDCRD addresses this by focusing on multi-scale feature decoupling.

Method: Uses multi-scale sliding-window pooling for granular feature capture, combined with sample categorization and a novel contrastive loss function.

Result: Achieves superior performance in homogeneous models and efficient knowledge transfer in heterogeneous pairs, with strong generalizability.

Conclusion: MSDCRD is effective, plug-and-play, and parameter-free, enhancing student model performance across various visual tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a technique aimed at enhancing the performance of a
small student network without increasing its parameter size by transferring
knowledge from a large, pre-trained teacher network. In the feature space,
different local regions within an individual global feature map often encode
distinct yet interdependent semantic information. However, previous methods
mainly focus on transferring global feature knowledge, neglecting the
decoupling of interdependent local regions within an individual global feature,
which often results in suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we
propose MSDCRD, a novel contrastive representation distillation approach that
explicitly performs multi-scale decoupling within the feature space. MSDCRD
employs a multi-scale sliding-window pooling approach within the feature space
to capture representations at various granularities effectively. This, in
conjunction with sample categorization, facilitates efficient multi-scale
feature decoupling. When integrated with a novel and effective contrastive loss
function, this forms the core of MSDCRD. Feature representations differ
significantly across network architectures, and this divergence becomes more
pronounced in heterogeneous models, rendering feature distillation particularly
challenging. Despite this, our method not only achieves superior performance in
homogeneous models but also enables efficient feature knowledge transfer across
a variety of heterogeneous teacher-student pairs, highlighting its strong
generalizability. Moreover, its plug-and-play and parameter-free nature enables
flexible integration with different visual tasks. Extensive experiments on
different visual benchmarks consistently confirm the superiority of our method
in enhancing the performance of student models.

*Qiwei Wang, Shaoxun Wu, Yujiao Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BevSplat resolves height ambiguity in weakly supervised cross-view localization using feature-based Gaussian primitives, outperforming prior methods on KITTI and VIGOR datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of height ambiguity in cross-view pose estimation due to lack of depth in ground images and satellite height maps.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian primitives with semantic/spatial features for BEV synthesis and introduces icosphere-based supervision for panoramic queries.

Result: Significantly improves localization accuracy on KITTI and VIGOR datasets.

Conclusion: BevSplat effectively resolves height ambiguity and enhances cross-view localization performance.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of weakly supervised cross-view
localization, where the goal is to estimate the pose of a ground camera
relative to a satellite image with noisy ground truth annotations. A common
approach to bridge the cross-view domain gap for pose estimation is Bird's-Eye
View (BEV) synthesis. However, existing methods struggle with height ambiguity
due to the lack of depth information in ground images and satellite height
maps. Previous solutions either assume a flat ground plane or rely on complex
models, such as cross-view transformers. We propose BevSplat, a novel method
that resolves height ambiguity by using feature-based Gaussian primitives. Each
pixel in the ground image is represented by a 3D Gaussian with semantic and
spatial features, which are synthesized into a BEV feature map for relative
pose estimation. Additionally, to address challenges with panoramic query
images, we introduce an icosphere-based supervision strategy for the Gaussian
primitives. We validate our method on the widely used KITTI and VIGOR datasets,
which include both pinhole and panoramic query images. Experimental results
show that BevSplat significantly improves localization accuracy over prior
approaches.

### [317] [OmnimatteZero: Fast Training-free Omnimatte with Pre-trained Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18033)
*Dvir Samuel, Matan Levy, Nir Darshan, Gal Chechik, Rami Ben-Ari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmnimatteZero is a training-free method using pre-trained video diffusion models for video decomposition, object removal, and compositing, achieving real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require extensive training or costly optimization, prompting a need for a simpler, efficient solution.

Method: Leverages zero-shot image inpainting techniques with temporal and spatial attention guidance for accurate object removal and background reconstruction.

Result: Superior background reconstruction and real-time performance, setting a speed record for Omnimatte approaches.

Conclusion: OmnimatteZero offers an efficient, training-free alternative for video decomposition and editing, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In Omnimatte, one aims to decompose a given video into semantically
meaningful layers, including the background and individual objects along with
their associated effects, such as shadows and reflections. Existing methods
often require extensive training or costly self-supervised optimization. In
this paper, we present OmnimatteZero, a training-free approach that leverages
off-the-shelf pre-trained video diffusion models for omnimatte. It can remove
objects from videos, extract individual object layers along with their effects,
and composite those objects onto new videos. These are accomplished by adapting
zero-shot image inpainting techniques for video object removal, a task they
fail to handle effectively out-of-the-box. To overcome this, we introduce
temporal and spatial attention guidance modules that steer the diffusion
process for accurate object removal and temporally consistent background
reconstruction. We further show that self-attention maps capture information
about the object and its footprints and use them to inpaint the object's
effects, leaving a clean background. Additionally, through simple latent
arithmetic, object layers can be isolated and recombined seamlessly with new
video layers to produce new videos. Evaluations show that OmnimatteZero not
only achieves superior performance in terms of background reconstruction but
also sets a new record for the fastest Omnimatte approach, achieving real-time
performance with minimal frame runtime.

### [318] [Video Summarization with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11199)
*Min Jung Lee, Dayoung Gong, Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LLMVS, a video summarization method using LLMs to better capture video semantics and human judgments, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of current video summarization methods that fail to capture video semantics due to reliance on visual features and temporal dynamics.

Method: Uses M-LLM to translate frames into captions, assesses frame importance with LLM, and refines scores via global attention.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over existing methods in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Highlights LLMs' potential for multimedia content processing.

Abstract: The exponential increase in video content poses significant challenges in
terms of efficient navigation, search, and retrieval, thus requiring advanced
video summarization techniques. Existing video summarization methods, which
heavily rely on visual features and temporal dynamics, often fail to capture
the semantics of video content, resulting in incomplete or incoherent
summaries. To tackle the challenge, we propose a new video summarization
framework that leverages the capabilities of recent Large Language Models
(LLMs), expecting that the knowledge learned from massive data enables LLMs to
evaluate video frames in a manner that better aligns with diverse semantics and
human judgments, effectively addressing the inherent subjectivity in defining
keyframes. Our method, dubbed LLM-based Video Summarization (LLMVS), translates
video frames into a sequence of captions using a Muti-modal Large Language
Model (M-LLM) and then assesses the importance of each frame using an LLM,
based on the captions in its local context. These local importance scores are
refined through a global attention mechanism in the entire context of video
captions, ensuring that our summaries effectively reflect both the details and
the overarching narrative. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed method over existing ones in standard benchmarks, highlighting
the potential of LLMs in the processing of multimedia content.

### [319] [Convex Relaxation for Robust Vanishing Point Estimation in Manhattan World](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04788)
*Bangyan Liao, Zhenjun Zhao, Haoang Li, Yi Zhou, Yingping Zeng, Hao Li, Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GlobustVP, a method for vanishing point (VP) detection in Manhattan worlds using convex relaxation, achieving efficiency, robustness, and global optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for VP detection are either sub-optimal or computationally expensive. The paper aims to balance optimality and efficiency.

Method: Uses convex relaxation via a truncated multi-selection error to jointly estimate VPs and line-VP associations, reformulating into a QCQP and relaxing into an SDP problem. Solves iteratively with outlier handling.

Result: GlobustVP outperforms prior methods in efficiency, robustness, and global optimality on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: GlobustVP provides a superior balance of efficiency and optimality for VP detection, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Determining the vanishing points (VPs) in a Manhattan world, as a fundamental
task in many 3D vision applications, consists of jointly inferring the line-VP
association and locating each VP. Existing methods are, however, either
sub-optimal solvers or pursuing global optimality at a significant cost of
computing time. In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation
techniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a
"soft" association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error, that
allows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations. This
approach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a
quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then
relaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP
problem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative
solver (called GlobustVP), which independently searches for one VP and its
associated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers. After
each independent update of all VPs, the mutual orthogonality between the three
VPs in a Manhattan world is reinforced via local refinement. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that GlobustVP
achieves a favorable balance between efficiency, robustness, and global
optimality compared to previous works. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/WU-CVGL/GlobustVP.

*Oishee Bintey Hoque, Nibir Chandra Mandal, Abhijin Adiga, Samarth Swarup, Sayjro Kossi Nouwakpo, Amanda Wilson, Madhav Marathe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KIIM improves irrigation mapping using a Swin-Transformer model with specialized features, achieving significant IoU improvements and reducing data dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate irrigation mapping is vital for sustainable agriculture, but existing spectral-based models are ineffective due to landscape complexity and limited data.

Method: KIIM uses a Swin-Transformer with crop-to-irrigation encoding, spatial attention, cross-attention, and weighted ensemble for multi-modal data.

Result: Achieves up to 22.9% IoU improvement over baselines, with 71.4% for drip irrigation, and 51% boost in cross-state transfer learning.

Conclusion: KIIM reduces manual labeling needs, making large-scale irrigation mapping feasible and cost-effective.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of irrigation methods is crucial for sustainable
agricultural practices and food systems. However, existing models that rely
solely on spectral features from satellite imagery are ineffective due to the
complexity of agricultural landscapes and limited training data, making this a
challenging problem. We present Knowledge-Informed Irrigation Mapping (KIIM), a
novel Swin-Transformer based approach that uses (i) a specialized projection
matrix to encode crop to irrigation probability, (ii) a spatial attention map
to identify agricultural lands from non-agricultural lands, (iii)
bi-directional cross-attention to focus complementary information from
different modalities, and (iv) a weighted ensemble for combining predictions
from images and crop information. Our experimentation on five states in the US
shows up to 22.9\% (IoU) improvement over baseline with a 71.4% (IoU)
improvement for hard-to-classify drip irrigation. In addition, we propose a
two-phase transfer learning approach to enhance cross-state irrigation mapping,
achieving a 51% IoU boost in a state with limited labeled data. The ability to
achieve baseline performance with only 40% of the training data highlights its
efficiency, reducing the dependency on extensive manual labeling efforts and
making large-scale, automated irrigation mapping more feasible and
cost-effective.

### [321] [SuperMapNet for Long-Range and High-Accuracy Vectorized HD Map Construction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13856)
*Ruqin Zhou, Chenguang Dai, Wanshou Jiang, Yongsheng Zhang, Hanyun Wang, San Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperMapNet improves HD map construction by combining camera and LiDAR data, enhancing feature generation and element classification for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for HD map construction have limitations in feature generation and element classification, leading to low accuracy and feature gaps.

Method: SuperMapNet uses cross-attention and flow-based modules for BEV feature generation and three-level interactions (Point2Point, Element2Element, Point2Element) for classification and localization.

Result: The method outperforms SOTAs by 14.9/8.8 mAP and 18.5/3.1 mAP on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets.

Conclusion: SuperMapNet achieves high-accuracy, long-range HD map construction by effectively integrating multi-modal data and element interactions.

Abstract: Vectorized HD map is essential for autonomous driving. Remarkable work has
been achieved in recent years, but there are still major issues: (1) in the
generation of the BEV features, single modality-based methods are of limited
perception capability, while direct concatenation-based multi-modal methods
fail to capture synergies and disparities between different modalities,
resulting in limited ranges with feature holes; (2) in the classification and
localization of map elements, only point information is used without the
consideration of element infor-mation and neglects the interaction between
point information and element information, leading to erroneous shapes and
element entanglement with low accuracy. To address above issues, we introduce
SuperMapNet for long-range and high-accuracy vectorized HD map construction. It
uses both camera images and LiDAR point clouds as input, and first tightly
couple semantic information from camera images and geometric information from
LiDAR point clouds by a cross-attention based synergy enhancement module and a
flow-based disparity alignment module for long-range BEV feature generation.
And then, local features from point queries and global features from element
queries are tightly coupled by three-level interactions for high-accuracy
classification and localization, where Point2Point interaction learns local
geometric information between points of the same element and of each point,
Element2Element interaction learns relation constraints between different
elements and semantic information of each elements, and Point2Element
interaction learns complement element information for its constituent points.
Experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate superior
performances, surpassing SOTAs over 14.9/8.8 mAP and 18.5/3.1 mAP under
hard/easy settings, respectively. The code is made publicly available1.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey on place recognition methods, covering CNN-based, Transformer-based, and cross-modal approaches, with insights into challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Place recognition is crucial for tasks like SLAM and long-term navigation, requiring robust methods to handle varying conditions.

Method: Reviews CNN-based, Transformer-based, and cross-modal strategies, highlighting their strengths and applications.

Result: Summarizes advancements, datasets, and metrics, identifying challenges like domain adaptation and real-time performance.

Conclusion: Outlines future research directions and provides a unified framework for place recognition methods.

Abstract: Place recognition is a cornerstone of vehicle navigation and mapping, which
is pivotal in enabling systems to determine whether a location has been
previously visited. This capability is critical for tasks such as loop closure
in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and long-term navigation under
varying environmental conditions. In this survey, we comprehensively review
recent advancements in place recognition, emphasizing three representative
methodological paradigms: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches,
Transformer-based frameworks, and cross-modal strategies. We begin by
elucidating the significance of place recognition within the broader context of
autonomous systems. Subsequently, we trace the evolution of CNN-based methods,
highlighting their contributions to robust visual descriptor learning and
scalability in large-scale environments. We then examine the emerging class of
Transformer-based models, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture
global dependencies and offer improved generalization across diverse scenes.
Furthermore, we discuss cross-modal approaches that integrate heterogeneous
data sources such as Lidar, vision, and text description, thereby enhancing
resilience to viewpoint, illumination, and seasonal variations. We also
summarize standard datasets and evaluation metrics widely adopted in the
literature. Finally, we identify current research challenges and outline
prospective directions, including domain adaptation, real-time performance, and
lifelong learning, to inspire future advancements in this domain. The unified
framework of leading-edge place recognition methods, i.e., code library, and

### [323] [FlowCut: Rethinking Redundancy via Information Flow for Efficient Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19536)
*Jintao Tong, Wenwei Jin, Pengda Qin, Anqi Li, Yixiong Zou, Yuhong Li, Yuhua Li, Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCut is a pruning framework for LVLMs that uses information flow analysis to identify redundant visual tokens, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods for LVLMs rely on single-layer attention scores, which may not sufficiently capture token redundancy due to complex interactions between tokens and layers.

Method: FlowCut analyzes information flow between tokens and layers, leveraging the CLS token as an information relay and observing progressive redundancy via attention concentration.

Result: FlowCut achieves superior performance, with 1.6% and 4.3% improvements on LLaVA models, 88.9% and 94.4% token reductions, and 3.2x speed-up.

Conclusion: FlowCut addresses the limitations of single-layer criteria, aligning better with model behaviors and significantly enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but
suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing
pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and
prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the
interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic
question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify
redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant
visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models
the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves
between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information
relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy
emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration;
and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to
contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an
information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the
current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the
model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves
superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token
reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x
speed-up in the prefilling stage. Our code is available at

Result: The dataset enables non-invasive spectral analysis and robust material classification, with openly available resources for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Electrolyzers-HSI accelerates critical raw material recovery, supporting smart and sustainable e-waste recycling solutions.

Abstract: The global challenge of sustainable recycling demands automated, fast, and
accurate, state-of-the-art (SOTA) material detection systems that act as a
bedrock for a circular economy. Democratizing access to these cutting-edge
solutions that enable real-time waste analysis is essential for scaling up
recycling efforts and fostering the Green Deal. In response, we introduce
\textbf{Electrolyzers-HSI}, a novel multimodal benchmark dataset designed to
accelerate the recovery of critical raw materials through accurate electrolyzer
materials classification. The dataset comprises 55 co-registered
high-resolution RGB images and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data cubes spanning
the 400--2500 nm spectral range, yielding over 4.2 million pixel vectors and
424,169 labeled ones. This enables non-invasive spectral analysis of shredded
electrolyzer samples, supporting quantitative and qualitative material
classification and spectral properties investigation. We evaluate a suite of
baseline machine learning (ML) methods alongside SOTA transformer-based deep
learning (DL) architectures, including Vision Transformer, SpectralFormer, and
the Multimodal Fusion Transformer, to investigate architectural bottlenecks for
further efficiency optimisation when deploying transformers in material
identification. We implement zero-shot detection techniques and majority voting
across pixel-level predictions to establish object-level classification
robustness. In adherence to the FAIR data principles, the electrolyzers-HSI

### [325] [Compositional Scene Understanding through Inverse Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21780)
*Yanbo Wang, Justin Dauwels, Yilun Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using generative models for scene understanding by treating it as an inverse generative modeling problem, enabling robust generalization to new scenes and objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend generative models beyond content synthesis to understand scene properties from natural images.

Method: Formulates scene understanding as inverse generative modeling, using compositional models to infer scene structure and global factors.

Result: Enables robust generalization to new scenes with more objects or new shapes, and zero-shot multi-object perception.

Conclusion: The approach successfully leverages generative models for scene understanding and generalization, applicable to pretrained models.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity visual content. In this work, we explore how generative models
can further be used not only to synthesize visual content but also to
understand the properties of a scene given a natural image. We formulate scene
understanding as an inverse generative modeling problem, where we seek to find
conditional parameters of a visual generative model to best fit a given natural
image. To enable this procedure to infer scene structure from images
substantially different than those seen during training, we further propose to
build this visual generative model compositionally from smaller models over
pieces of a scene. We illustrate how this procedure enables us to infer the set
of objects in a scene, enabling robust generalization to new test scenes with
an increased number of objects of new shapes. We further illustrate how this
enables us to infer global scene factors, likewise enabling robust
generalization to new scenes. Finally, we illustrate how this approach can be
directly applied to existing pretrained text-to-image generative models for
zero-shot multi-object perception. Code and visualizations are at

*Rui Xia, Dan Jiang, Quan Zhang, Ke Zhang, Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a CLIP-assisted cross-view audiovisual method for unsupervised temporal action localization (UTAL) to address challenges of over-focus on discriminative regions and lack of contextual boundary information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TAL methods rely on labeled data, which is costly. UTAL avoids this but faces issues with feature focus and modality limitations.

Method: Uses visual language pre-training (VLP) and audio perception for richer context, plus a self-supervised cross-view learning paradigm.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances UTAL by leveraging multi-modal data and self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) has garnered significant attention in
information retrieval. Existing supervised or weakly supervised methods heavily
rely on labeled temporal boundaries and action categories, which are
labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, unsupervised temporal action
localization (UTAL) has gained popularity. However, current methods face two
main challenges: 1) Classification pre-trained features overly focus on highly
discriminative regions; 2) Solely relying on visual modality information makes
it difficult to determine contextual boundaries. To address these issues, we
propose a CLIP-assisted cross-view audiovisual enhanced UTAL method.
Specifically, we introduce visual language pre-training (VLP) and
classification pre-training-based collaborative enhancement to avoid excessive
focus on highly discriminative regions; we also incorporate audio perception to
provide richer contextual boundary information. Finally, we introduce a
self-supervised cross-view learning paradigm to achieve multi-view perceptual
enhancement without additional annotations. Extensive experiments on two public
datasets demonstrate our model's superiority over several state-of-the-art
competitors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable contextual AI in smart glasses by recognizing when users are reading, extending beyond constrained settings to diverse real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses a multimodal approach with egocentric RGB, eye gaze, and head pose data, employing a flexible transformer model to analyze these modalities individually or combined.

Result: Demonstrates the relevance and complementarity of the modalities for reading recognition and shows the dataset's utility for classifying reading types.

Conclusion: The work advances reading understanding studies by introducing a scalable, diverse dataset and a robust multimodal model for real-world applications.

Abstract: To enable egocentric contextual AI in always-on smart glasses, it is crucial
to be able to keep a record of the user's interactions with the world,
including during reading. In this paper, we introduce a new task of reading
recognition to determine when the user is reading. We first introduce the
first-of-its-kind large-scale multimodal Reading in the Wild dataset,
containing 100 hours of reading and non-reading videos in diverse and realistic
scenarios. We then identify three modalities (egocentric RGB, eye gaze, head
pose) that can be used to solve the task, and present a flexible transformer
model that performs the task using these modalities, either individually or
combined. We show that these modalities are relevant and complementary to the
task, and investigate how to efficiently and effectively encode each modality.
Additionally, we show the usefulness of this dataset towards classifying types
of reading, extending current reading understanding studies conducted in
constrained settings to larger scale, diversity and realism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic framework for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), addressing challenges of dataset conflicts and proposing an optimal data mixture strategy to enhance generalization and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend RLVR to MLLMs, which face complexities due to diverse vision-language tasks, and to improve performance by optimizing dataset mixtures.

Method: The method involves a multimodal RLVR framework for multi-dataset post-training, including a curated dataset for verifiable vision-language problems and a data mixture strategy predicting RL fine-tuning outcomes.

Result: Results show a 5.24% average accuracy improvement on out-of-distribution benchmarks with the best mixture, and a 20.74% total improvement over the pre-finetuning baseline.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the effectiveness of multi-domain RLVR training with mixture prediction strategies in boosting MLLM reasoning capacities.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving
state-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers.
Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but
is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks
that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such,
training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates
challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets,
highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve
generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework
for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation
and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR
framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains
different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online
RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture
strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data
mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture.
Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when
combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM
general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained
model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24%
compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a
total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored integration of chain-of-thought reasoning and RL in generative vision models.

Method: A two-stage framework: supervised fine-tuning on a reasoning dataset, followed by output refinement using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: ReasonGen-R1 outperforms baselines on GenEval, DPG, and T2I benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines reasoning and RL for improved generative vision models.

Abstract: Although chain-of-thought reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) have
driven breakthroughs in NLP, their integration into generative vision models
remains underexplored. We introduce ReasonGen-R1, a two-stage framework that
first imbues an autoregressive image generator with explicit text-based
"thinking" skills via supervised fine-tuning on a newly generated reasoning
dataset of written rationales, and then refines its outputs using Group
Relative Policy Optimization. To enable the model to reason through text before
generating images, We automatically generate and release a corpus of model
crafted rationales paired with visual prompts, enabling controlled planning of
object layouts, styles, and scene compositions. Our GRPO algorithm uses reward
signals from a pretrained vision language model to assess overall visual
quality, optimizing the policy in each update. Evaluations on GenEval, DPG, and
the T2I benchmark demonstrate that ReasonGen-R1 consistently outperforms strong
baselines and prior state-of-the-art models. More: aka.ms/reasongen.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in current approaches to mitigating data bias in face recognition models by reevaluating ethnicity labels.

Method: Revising ethnicity labels as continuous variables, validating experimentally and theoretically with extensive model training and dataset subsets.

Result: Models trained on datasets balanced in continuous space outperform those using discrete labels.

Conclusion: Continuous ethnicity labeling provides a more effective way to balance datasets and reduce bias in face recognition models.

Abstract: Bias has been a constant in face recognition models. Over the years,
researchers have looked at it from both the model and the data point of view.
However, their approach to mitigation of data bias was limited and lacked
insight on the real nature of the problem. Here, in this document, we propose
to revise our use of ethnicity labels as a continuous variable instead of a
discrete value per identity. We validate our formulation both experimentally
and theoretically, showcasing that not all identities from one ethnicity
contribute equally to the balance of the dataset; thus, having the same number
of identities per ethnicity does not represent a balanced dataset. We further
show that models trained on datasets balanced in the continuous space
consistently outperform models trained on data balanced in the discrete space.
We trained more than 65 different models, and created more than 20 subsets of
the original datasets.

*Lingwei Dang, Ruizhi Shao, Hongwen Zhang, Wei Min, Yebin Liu, Qingyao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combines visual priors and dynamic constraints in a synchronized diffusion process to generate Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) videos and motion simultaneously, enhancing consistency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOI generation methods rely on predefined 3D models or sacrifice physical plausibility for visual fidelity, limiting generalization.

Method: The framework uses tri-modal adaptive modulation and 3D full-attention to align features, coupled with a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model for closed-loop feedback.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity, physically plausible HOI sequences, with strong generalization in unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework eliminates dependencies on predefined models and enhances video-motion consistency, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation has significant application
potential. However, current 3D HOI motion generation approaches heavily rely on
predefined 3D object models and lab-captured motion data, limiting
generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, HOI video generation methods prioritize
pixel-level visual fidelity, often sacrificing physical plausibility.
Recognizing that visual appearance and motion patterns share fundamental
physical laws in the real world, we propose a novel framework that combines
visual priors and dynamic constraints within a synchronized diffusion process
to generate the HOI video and motion simultaneously. To integrate the
heterogeneous semantics, appearance, and motion features, our method implements
tri-modal adaptive modulation for feature aligning, coupled with 3D
full-attention for modeling inter- and intra-modal dependencies. Furthermore,
we introduce a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model that generates
explicit 3D interaction sequences directly from the synchronized diffusion
outputs, then feeds them back to establish a closed-loop feedback cycle. This
architecture eliminates dependencies on predefined object models or explicit
pose guidance while significantly enhancing video-motion consistency.
Experimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art
approaches in generating high-fidelity, dynamically plausible HOI sequences,
with notable generalization capabilities in unseen real-world scenarios.

*Hongtao Huang, Xiaojun Chang, Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flexiffusion is a training-free NAS framework for diffusion models, optimizing generation schedules and architectures without retraining, achieving significant speedups with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models (DMs) are computationally expensive due to iterative inference. Existing NAS methods are inefficient due to retraining needs, high search complexity, and slow evaluation.

Method: Flexiffusion decomposes generation into flexible segments with dynamic step types (full, partial, null) and introduces rFID for lightweight evaluation.

Result: Achieves 2× to 5.1× speedup on various DMs with <5% FID degradation and near-identical CLIP scores.

Conclusion: Flexiffusion pioneers a resource-efficient paradigm for high-speed DMs without quality sacrifice.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models capable of producing
high-fidelity images but are constrained by high computational costs due to
iterative multi-step inference. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can
optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements,
exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation
relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose
Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation
schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our
key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of
equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full
(complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped
computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool
exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural
diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation
metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead
of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\%$. In practice,
Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable
Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\%$,
outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\times$
speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores. Our work pioneers
a resource-efficient paradigm for searching high-speed DMs without sacrificing
quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaRA-SAM improves SAM's robustness to input degradations using lightweight adapters and dynamic rank adjustment, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing SAM's robustness for high-stakes applications like autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: Introduces gated-rank adaptation (GaRA) with lightweight adapters and dynamic rank adjustment.

Result: GaRA-SAM surpasses prior work, achieving up to 21.3%p higher IoU on ACDC.

Conclusion: GaRA-SAM effectively robustifies SAM without compromising generalization, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Improving robustness of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to input
degradations is critical for its deployment in high-stakes applications such as
autonomous driving and robotics. Our approach to this challenge prioritizes
three key aspects: first, parameter efficiency to maintain the inherent
generalization capability of SAM; second, fine-grained and input-aware
robustification to precisely address the input corruption; and third, adherence
to standard training protocols for ease of training. To this end, we propose
gated-rank adaptation (GaRA). GaRA introduces lightweight adapters into
intermediate layers of the frozen SAM, where each adapter dynamically adjusts
the effective rank of its weight matrix based on the input by selectively
activating (rank-1) components of the matrix using a learned gating module.
This adjustment enables fine-grained and input-aware robustification without
compromising the generalization capability of SAM. Our model, GaRA-SAM,
significantly outperforms prior work on all robust segmentation benchmarks. In
particular, it surpasses the previous best IoU score by up to 21.3\%p on ACDC,
a challenging real corrupted image dataset.

TL;DR: UniWorld-V1 is a unified generative framework leveraging semantic features from multimodal LLMs and contrastive encoders, achieving strong performance in image tasks with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified models lack capabilities in image perception and manipulation, despite practical demand. GPT-4o-Image's advanced performance inspired the exploration of semantic encoders over VAEs.

Method: Proposes UniWorld-V1, a framework using semantic features from multimodal LLMs and contrastive encoders, trained on 2.7M data.

Result: UniWorld-V1 excels in image understanding, generation, manipulation, and perception.

Conclusion: The framework is open-sourced to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Although existing unified models achieve strong performance in
vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, they remain limited
in addressing image perception and manipulation -- capabilities increasingly
demanded in practical applications. Recently, OpenAI introduced the powerful
GPT-4o-Image model, which showcases advanced capabilities in comprehensive
image perception and manipulation, sparking widespread interest. Through
carefully designed experiments, we observe that GPT-4o-Image likely relies on
semantic encoders rather than VAEs for feature extraction, despite VAEs being
commonly regarded as crucial for image manipulation tasks. Inspired by this
insight, we propose UniWorld-V1, a unified generative framework built upon
semantic features extracted from powerful multimodal large language models and
contrastive semantic encoders. Using only 2.7M training data, UniWorld-V1
achieves impressive performance across diverse tasks, including image
understanding, generation, manipulation, and perception. We fully open-source
the UniWorld-V1 framework, including model weights, training and evaluation
scripts, and datasets to promote reproducibility and further research.

*Xiaoyi Liu, Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOLIAGE is a physics-informed multimodal world model for unbounded accretive surface growth, using a shared latent state and physics-aware prediction to outperform baselines in physical intelligence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance physical intelligence by creating a robust, multimodal world model for dynamic surface growth, addressing challenges like partial observations and multisensory data.

Method: Combines a unified context encoder for multimodal inputs, a physics-aware predictor, and an Accretive Graph Network (AGN) with techniques like Energy-Gated Message-Passing and Hierarchical Pooling.

Result: Outperforms specialized baselines in tasks like topology recognition and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating resilience in stress tests.

Conclusion: FOLIAGE establishes a new pathway for multimodal physical intelligence, robust across dynamic environments.

Abstract: Physical intelligence -- anticipating and shaping the world from partial,
multisensory observations -- is critical for next-generation world models. We
propose FOLIAGE, a physics-informed multimodal world model for unbounded
accretive surface growth. In its Action-Perception loop, a unified context
encoder maps images, mesh connectivity, and point clouds to a shared latent
state. A physics-aware predictor, conditioned on physical control actions,
advances this latent state in time to align with the target latent of the
surface, yielding a Modality-Agnostic Growth Embedding (MAGE) that interfaces
with critic heads for downstream objectives. FOLIAGE's Accretive Graph Network
(AGN) captures dynamic connectivity through Age Positional Encoding and
Energy-Gated Message-Passing. Geometry-Correspondence Fusion and Cross-Patch
Masking enhance MAGE's expressiveness, while Hierarchical Pooling balances
global context with local dynamics. We create SURF-GARDEN, a world model
learning platform comprising a Counterfactual Physics Simulator, a Multimodal
Correspondence Extractor, and Evolution Tracing, which generates 7,200 diverse
surface-growth sequences. SURF-BENCH, our physical-intelligence evaluation
suite, evaluates six core tasks -- topology recognition, inverse material
estimation, growth-stage classification, latent roll-out, cross-modal
retrieval, and dense correspondence -- and four stress tests -- sensor dropout,
zero-shot modality transfer, long-horizon prediction, and physics ablation --
to probe resilience. FOLIAGE outperforms specialized baselines while remaining
robust across dynamic environments, establishing a new world-model based,
multimodal pathway to physical intelligence.

*Tanqiu Qiao, Ruochen Li, Frederick W. B. Li, Yoshiki Kubotani, Shigeo Morishima, Hubert P. H. Shum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoVis-GNN, a method for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition in videos by fusing visual and geometric features using dual-attention and graph learning. It also presents the MPHOI-120 dataset for real-world HOI scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to effectively fuse visual and geometric features for HOI recognition without losing their unique strengths, and to address challenges in real-world scenarios like concurrent actions and occlusions.

Method: Proposes GeoVis-GNN, which uses dual-attention feature fusion and interdependent entity graph learning to build from entity-specific representations to interaction understanding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in various HOI scenarios, including complex concurrent interactions.

Conclusion: The bottom-up approach of GeoVis-GNN and the MPHOI-120 dataset advance HOI recognition, demonstrating effectiveness in diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition in videos requires understanding
both visual patterns and geometric relationships as they evolve over time.
Visual and geometric features offer complementary strengths. Visual features
capture appearance context, while geometric features provide structural
patterns. Effectively fusing these multimodal features without compromising
their unique characteristics remains challenging. We observe that establishing
robust, entity-specific representations before modeling interactions helps
preserve the strengths of each modality. Therefore, we hypothesize that a
bottom-up approach is crucial for effective multimodal fusion. Following this
insight, we propose the Geometric Visual Fusion Graph Neural Network
(GeoVis-GNN), which uses dual-attention feature fusion combined with
interdependent entity graph learning. It progressively builds from
entity-specific representations toward high-level interaction understanding. To
advance HOI recognition to real-world scenarios, we introduce the Concurrent
Partial Interaction Dataset (MPHOI-120). It captures dynamic multi-person
interactions involving concurrent actions and partial engagement. This dataset
helps address challenges like complex human-object dynamics and mutual
occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
across various HOI scenarios. These scenarios include two-person interactions,
single-person activities, bimanual manipulations, and complex concurrent
partial interactions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [337] [Images are Worth Variable Length of Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03643)
*Lingjun Mao, Rodolfo Corona, Xin Liang, Wenhao Yan, Zineng Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOVE is a dynamic vision encoder that adapts token count per image, improving efficiency and semantic feature extraction over fixed-length methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-length token sequences in vision encoders ignore varying information content in images, leading to inefficiency.

Method: DOVE produces variable-length visual tokens for image reconstruction and extends to query-conditioned tokenization for targeted semantic extraction.

Result: DOVE reduces average token count while maintaining high reconstruction quality and outperforms fixed-length methods in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: DOVE offers efficient, adaptive tokenization with superior semantic feature extraction, enhanced by query-conditioned focus.

Abstract: Most existing vision encoders map images into a fixed-length sequence of
tokens, overlooking the fact that different images contain varying amounts of
information. For example, a visually complex image (e.g., a cluttered room)
inherently carries more information and thus deserves more tokens than a simple
image (e.g., a blank wall). To address this inefficiency, we propose DOVE, a
dynamic vision encoder that produces a variable number of visual tokens (i.e.,
continuous representation vectors) to reconstruct each image. Our results show
that DOVE significantly reduces the average number of tokens while maintaining
high reconstruction quality. In several linear probing and downstream
multimodal tasks, it outperforms existing autoencoder-based tokenization
methods when using far fewer tokens, capturing more expressive semantic
features compared to fixed-length encoding. We further extend DOVE with
query-conditioned tokenization. By guiding the model to focus on query-relevant
regions, it achieves more efficient and targeted semantic extraction. Our code
and checkpoints are available at https://dove-encoder.github.io/dove-encoder.

TL;DR: MambaNeXt-YOLO is a new object detection framework combining CNNs and Mamba for efficient real-time performance, achieving 66.6% mAP at 31.9 FPS on PASCAL VOC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient real-time object detection with limited resources, balancing speed and accuracy, motivates the integration of CNNs and Mamba.

Method: Proposes MambaNeXt Block (hybrid CNN-Mamba), MAFPN for multi-scale detection, and focuses on edge efficiency.

Result: Achieves 66.6% mAP at 31.9 FPS on PASCAL VOC, suitable for edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson.

Conclusion: MambaNeXt-YOLO effectively balances accuracy and efficiency for real-time object detection, even on edge devices.

Abstract: Real-time object detection is a fundamental but challenging task in computer
vision, particularly when computational resources are limited. Although
YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy,
the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of
Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high
computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which
limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these
challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba,
provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with
linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel
object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three
key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs
with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range
dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an
enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object
detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our
method achieved 66.6% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any
pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson
Xavier NX and Orin NX.

TL;DR: A hierarchical interaction feature representation and coarse-to-fine reasoning module improve human motion prediction in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex scenes with abundant interactions complicate human behavior analysis and motion prediction, challenging existing methods.

Method: Proposes hierarchical interaction features (high-level for context, low-level for details) and a coarse-to-fine reasoning module using spatial and frequency perspectives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses challenges in complex scenes, enhancing motion prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Complex scenes present significant challenges for predicting human behaviour
due to the abundance of interaction information, such as human-human and
humanenvironment interactions. These factors complicate the analysis and
understanding of human behaviour, thereby increasing the uncertainty in
forecasting human motions. Existing motion prediction methods thus struggle in
these complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose an effective method for
human motion forecasting in interactive scenes. To achieve a comprehensive
representation of interactions, we design a hierarchical interaction feature
representation so that high-level features capture the overall context of the
interactions, while low-level features focus on fine-grained details. Besides,
we propose a coarse-to-fine interaction reasoning module that leverages both
spatial and frequency perspectives to efficiently utilize hierarchical
features, thereby enhancing the accuracy of motion predictions. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four public datasets. Code will be
released when this paper is published.

TL;DR: RAID dataset evaluates adversarial robustness of AI-generated image detectors, revealing vulnerabilities in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of adversarial robustness evaluation in AI-generated image detectors due to awareness gaps or effort constraints.

Method: Create RAID, a dataset of 72k adversarial examples, by attacking seven detectors and four text-to-image models.

Result: Adversarial images transfer well to unseen detectors, exposing vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Current detectors are easily deceived, emphasizing the need for more robust solutions.

Abstract: AI-generated images have reached a quality level at which humans are
incapable of reliably distinguishing them from real images. To counteract the
inherent risk of fraud and disinformation, the detection of AI-generated images
is a pressing challenge and an active research topic. While many of the
presented methods claim to achieve high detection accuracy, they are usually
evaluated under idealized conditions. In particular, the adversarial robustness
is often neglected, potentially due to a lack of awareness or the substantial
effort required to conduct a comprehensive robustness analysis. In this work,
we tackle this problem by providing a simpler means to assess the robustness of
AI-generated image detectors. We present RAID (Robust evaluation of
AI-generated image Detectors), a dataset of 72k diverse and highly transferable
adversarial examples. The dataset is created by running attacks against an
ensemble of seven state-of-the-art detectors and images generated by four
different text-to-image models. Extensive experiments show that our methodology
generates adversarial images that transfer with a high success rate to unseen
detectors, which can be used to quickly provide an approximate yet still
reliable estimate of a detector's adversarial robustness. Our findings indicate
that current state-of-the-art AI-generated image detectors can be easily
deceived by adversarial examples, highlighting the critical need for the
development of more robust methods. We release our dataset at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FullDiT2 improves efficiency in video diffusion transformers by reducing redundant computations in in-context conditioning, achieving faster processing with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency of existing in-context conditioning methods, like FullDiT, due to quadratic computation overhead, hinders practical deployment.

Method: FullDiT2 introduces dynamic token selection and selective context caching to reduce redundancy in context tokens and interactions.

Result: FullDiT2 achieves 2-3 times speedup per diffusion step with minimal degradation in video generation quality.

Conclusion: FullDiT2 offers an efficient and effective framework for general controllability in video generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Fine-grained and efficient controllability on video diffusion transformers
has raised increasing desires for the applicability. Recently, In-context
Conditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video
generation, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context
conditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token
sequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite
their effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task
complexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study
the efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video
generation framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key
sources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within
context condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent
interactions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we
propose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general
controllability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates
from two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2
leverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important
context tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention.
Additionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize
redundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive
experiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks
demonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3
times speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal
degradation or even higher performance in video generation quality. The project

Conclusion: ProLoRA provides an efficient solution for adapting fine-tuning in text-to-image models without the need for additional training data.

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to ensure contextual integrity (CI) in autonomous agents by using LLM reasoning and reinforcement learning, reducing inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring contextual integrity (CI) is crucial as autonomous agents make decisions for users, requiring reasoning about appropriate information sharing in specific contexts.

Method: The approach involves prompting LLMs to reason about CI and developing an RL framework to instill CI reasoning. A synthetic dataset of ~700 examples is used for training.

Result: The method significantly reduces inappropriate information disclosure without compromising task performance, with improvements transferring to human-annotated benchmarks like PrivacyLens.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses CI by combining explicit reasoning and RL, demonstrating scalability and transferability to real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Motivation: To enhance multi-agent systems by leveraging LLMs for better coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated environments.

Method: Uses a framework with Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory modules, trained with PPO and language-conditioned loss, evaluated in game environments.

Result: Shows improved win rates, coordination, and zero-shot generalization over baselines, with subgoal generation and messaging being key contributors.

Conclusion: LLM-MARL bridges language and policy learning, advancing intelligent multi-agent systems for games and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for

*Tapio Pitkäranta, Leena Pitkäranta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HADA is a framework-agnostic architecture aligning AI and legacy algorithms with organizational goals using role-specific stakeholder agents. It ensures transparency, ethical compliance, and decision traceability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address alignment challenges between AI/legacy systems and organizational values, ensuring human oversight and ethical compliance in decision-making.

Method: HADA wraps algorithms/LLMs in stakeholder agents (business, data-science, audit, ethics, customer) with conversational APIs. It propagates alignment objectives in natural language and logs decisions.

Result: Demonstrated complete coverage of six objectives, including bias mitigation and decision lineage tracing, in a credit-scoring proof of concept.

Conclusion: HADA improves accuracy, transparency, and ethical compliance in decision pipelines, supported by empirical evidence and open-source contributions.

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

*Yongjin Yang, Sinjae Kang, Juyong Lee, Dongjun Lee, Se-Young Yun, Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EXIF is a novel framework for automatic skill discovery in LLM-powered agents, using an exploration-first strategy and iterative feedback to improve feasibility and performance without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLM agents for diverse tasks is challenging due to manual effort in dataset creation, invalid task proposals, and lack of meaningful learning signals.

Method: EXIF employs an exploration agent (Alice) to generate feasible skills, trains the target agent (Bob), and uses iterative feedback to refine skills.

Result: Experiments on Webshop and Crafter show EXIF effectively discovers skills and improves agent performance, even with Alice and Bob as the same model.

Conclusion: EXIF enables self-evolving LLM agents by automating skill discovery and iterative improvement, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

*Jack David Carson, Amir Reisizadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A statistical physics framework models Transformer LMs' reasoning as a stochastic dynamical system, identifying four latent reasoning regimes and enabling low-cost simulation of critical transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the emergent reasoning in Transformer LMs, which resists mechanistic analysis, by modeling it as a continuous-time stochastic process.

Method: A drift-diffusion system on a lower-dimensional manifold, using latent regime switching to capture reasoning phases, validated with empirical data from 8 models and 7 benchmarks.

Result: A rank-40 projection explains ~50% variance, revealing four latent reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is validated to capture these features.

Conclusion: The framework provides tools to simulate and predict critical reasoning transitions, such as misaligned states or LM failures.

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

*Peter Jansen, Samiah Hassan, Ruoyao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dataset called Matter-of-Fact is introduced to assess the feasibility of scientific hypotheses, aiming to reduce costly automated experiments by filtering hypotheses. Current models struggle, but expert verification suggests solvability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of automated experiments in scientific discovery by filtering hypotheses for feasibility, enabling scalable and impactful research.

Method: Creation of the Matter-of-Fact dataset with 8.4k claims from materials science topics, evaluated using retrieval-augmented generation and code generation baselines.

Result: Baseline models achieve up to 72% performance (chance is 50%), with experts indicating most claims are solvable, highlighting the task's difficulty.

Conclusion: The dataset presents a challenging yet solvable task, with potential to significantly advance automated scientific discovery by improving hypothesis filtering.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A graph-based framework improves multi-table QA by leveraging relational knowledge for schema linking, outperforming existing methods on complex datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-table QA struggle with complex, real-world scenarios due to unreliable schema linking.

Method: Proposes a graph-based framework using human-curated relational knowledge to encode schema links and join paths, with pruning and sub-path merging for efficiency.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on standard benchmarks and a large-scale realistic dataset.

Conclusion: The first multi-table QA system successfully applied to complex industrial tabular data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A ranking-based monitoring system using AI anomaly detection improves public health data monitoring, outperforming traditional alert-based methods with a 54x efficiency boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional alert-based systems are inefficient for modern public health data due to constant threshold resets and lag issues.

Method: Proposes a ranking-based monitoring paradigm leveraging AI anomaly detection, deployed in a national organization.

Result: Deployed system monitored 5M daily data points, improving reviewer speed efficiency by 54x over traditional methods.

Conclusion: Human-centered AI can transform public health decision-making by enhancing monitoring efficiency.

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

### [352] [Matching Markets Meet LLMs: Algorithmic Reasoning with Ranked Preferences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04478)
*Hadi Hosseini, Samarth Khanna, Ronak Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains like matching markets, despite their success in other reasoning tasks. Fine-tuning helps in small markets but not large ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains, focusing on matching markets for applications like resource allocation.

Method: Evaluated state-of-the-art models on preference-based reasoning tasks (stable-matching generation, instability detection/resolution, preference queries) to identify limitations.

Result: Top models struggle with instability in large markets, failing to identify blocking pairs or iterate algorithms. Fine-tuning (LoRA) improves small-market performance but not large ones.

Conclusion: More sophisticated strategies are needed to enhance LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs in combinatorial domains.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogMath introduces a fine-grained evaluation framework for LLMs' mathematical abilities, revealing overestimation of their capabilities by 30%-40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation paradigms for LLMs' mathematical abilities are insufficient, relying only on overall answer accuracy.

Method: CogMath formalizes human reasoning into 3 stages (problem comprehension, solving, summarization) and 9 dimensions, using a multi-agent system for assessment.

Result: Application on 7 LLMs shows their capabilities are overestimated by 30%-40%, with strengths and weaknesses identified.

Conclusion: CogMath provides deeper insights into LLMs' mathematical reasoning, aiding future enhancements.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STPR is a framework using LLMs to translate natural language constraints into executable Python functions for robotic navigation, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of translating informal, complex natural language constraints into formal descriptions for robotic planning.

Method: STPR leverages LLMs to generate Python functions from constraints, applied to point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms.

Result: Experiments show STPR ensures full compliance with constraints, short runtimes, and works with smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: STPR effectively bridges the gap between natural language constraints and robotic planning, offering practical applicability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

TL;DR: The paper studies security risks in multi-agent AI systems, focusing on how compromised agents can spread malicious prompts. It evaluates defense strategies, highlighting a trade-off between security and collaboration efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for secure autonomous multi-agent systems, especially when attackers compromise agents to spread malicious instructions.

Method: Simulations of agent collaborations were used to study security risks. Defense strategies like "vaccination" (false memories) and safety instructions were tested.

Result: Defenses reduced malicious instruction spread but also lowered collaboration capability, showing a security-efficiency trade-off.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need to balance security and efficiency in multi-agent AI systems for effective collaboration.

Abstract: As AI agents are increasingly adopted to collaborate on complex objectives,
ensuring the security of autonomous multi-agent systems becomes crucial. We
develop simulations of agents collaborating on shared objectives to study these
security risks and security trade-offs. We focus on scenarios where an attacker
compromises one agent, using it to steer the entire system toward misaligned
outcomes by corrupting other agents. In this context, we observe infectious
malicious prompts - the multi-hop spreading of malicious instructions. To
mitigate this risk, we evaluated several strategies: two "vaccination"
approaches that insert false memories of safely handling malicious input into
the agents' memory stream, and two versions of a generic safety instruction
strategy. While these defenses reduce the spread and fulfillment of malicious
instructions in our experiments, they tend to decrease collaboration capability
in the agent network. Our findings illustrate potential trade-off between
security and collaborative efficiency in multi-agent systems, providing
insights for designing more secure yet effective AI collaborations.

Motivation: Traditional schema creation is resource-intensive, requiring experts. LLMs offer a scalable, automated alternative.

Method: LLM-based pipelines use local and global KG information to generate ShEx schemas, evaluated with new datasets and metrics.

Result: LLMs produce high-quality ShEx schemas, demonstrating scalability for large KGs.

Conclusion: LLMs enable efficient, automated schema generation, advancing structured generation challenges for formalisms like ShEx.

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured

Motivation: Current AI systems lack contextual understanding and adaptability for smallholder farmers, and general-purpose LLMs provide generic recommendations. OpenAg addresses these gaps.

Method: OpenAg integrates domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer learning.

Result: The system offers context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights by combining scientific knowledge with farmer expertise.

Conclusion: OpenAg bridges the gap between scientific knowledge and practical farming expertise, enabling scalable and locally relevant decision-making.

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

TL;DR: DeePoly combines DNNs and polynomial bases for solving PDEs, improving accuracy and efficiency while ensuring convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DNN-based methods for PDEs lack convergence guarantees and efficiency compared to numerical schemes.

Method: DeePoly uses a two-stage approach: DNNs for global features and polynomial bases for local corrections.

Result: The framework enhances high-order accuracy and efficiency, maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties.

Conclusion: DeePoly offers a robust solution for PDEs, supported by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pre-operative critic mechanism for GUI automation, proposing S-GRPO and a data pipeline to improve decision reliability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI automation requires precise, error-free decision-making due to its online, interactive nature, where mistakes can lead to irreversible outcomes.

Method: The authors propose S-GRPO for the GUI-Critic-R1 model, incorporating a suggestion reward, and develop a data collection pipeline for training and testing.

Result: GUI-Critic-R1 outperforms current MLLMs in critic accuracy and improves success rates and efficiency in GUI automation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The pre-operative critic mechanism and S-GRPO strategy enhance reliability and performance in GUI automation tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

*Lucas Irwin, Arda Kaz, Peiyao Sheng, Pramod Viswanath*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHANCERY, a corporate governance reasoning benchmark for NLP models, testing their ability to classify actions as consistent with corporate charters. SOTA models struggle, achieving 64.5%-78.1% accuracy, highlighting the challenge of legal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal datasets lack focus on reasoning tasks, despite reasoning being central to legal practice. The paper addresses this gap by creating a benchmark for corporate governance reasoning.

Method: The benchmark includes corporate charters and executive proposals, requiring binary classification of action consistency. It uses 24 governance principles and 79 real charters from diverse industries.

Result: SOTA models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o score 64.5% and 75.2%, while reasoning agents (ReAct, CodeAct) perform better (76.1%, 78.1%). Analysis reveals model weaknesses in legal reasoning.

Conclusion: CHANCERY highlights the difficulty of legal reasoning for NLP models and provides insights into their capabilities, paving the way for improved legal AI systems.

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life

*Nikolas Belle, Dakota Barnes, Alfonso Amayuelas, Ivan Bercovich, Xin Eric Wang, William Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based agents self-improve in strategic planning by autonomously rewriting prompts and code, outperforming static baselines in the game Settlers of Catan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' struggles with long-term strategic planning by testing their ability to self-improve in challenging environments.

Method: A multi-agent architecture (Analyzer, Researcher, Coder, Player) iteratively analyzes gameplay, researches strategies, and modifies agent logic or prompts, benchmarked in Settlers of Catan.

Result: Self-evolving agents, especially with Claude 3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by adapting strategies and demonstrating adaptive reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively self-improve in strategic tasks when given the right architecture and environment.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

*Zhichao Yang, Jiashu He, Mohammad B. Al-Khasawneh, Darshan Pandit, Cirillo Cinzia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces E-bike agents, a framework using LLMs to classify and extract safety variables from unstructured e-bike incident reports, achieving high accuracy and revealing key accident factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in e-bike accidents and the lack of structured data for quantitative safety analysis motivated the development of a scalable solution using LLMs.

Method: The framework employs four LLM agents for classification, information extraction, injury cause determination, and component linkage, followed by an ordered logit model to analyze incident severity.

Result: Equipment issues are slightly more common than human-related causes, but human-related incidents are more fatal. The model achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.87.

Conclusion: The framework effectively extracts and analyzes e-bike safety data, offering scalable insights for improving safety policies and designs.

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ABM methods struggle to emulate human-like economic activities in MMOs due to limitations in agent reliability, sociability, and interpretability.

Method: The study employs LLMs to design agents with human-like decision-making, leveraging their role-playing, perception, memory, and reasoning abilities.

Result: Simulation experiments show LLM-driven agents can produce emergent phenomena like role specialization and price fluctuations aligned with market rules.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a promising solution to enhance ABM in MMO economies by improving agent adaptability and human-like behavior.

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced
by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant
challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among
agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and
interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a
novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation.
Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role
specialization and price fluctuations in line with market rules.

*Jiayu Wang, Yifei Ming, Zixuan Ke, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty, Aws Albarghouthi, Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL enhances reasoning in language models by improving internal strategy formulation and knowledge integration, not just plan execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the specific advantages of RL-based training methods like GRPO in enhancing reasoning capabilities of language models.

Method: Introduces a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect RL's impact on reasoning, focusing on plan-following, problem decomposition, and knowledge utilization.

Result: RL-tuned models show robustness and better knowledge integration, though explicit plans degrade performance on hard tasks.

Conclusion: RL empowers models to develop internal strategies and integrate knowledge, providing a foundation for better training and evaluation of reasoning models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency in benchmark results of reasoning models, which makes performance claims hard to reproduce.

Method: Empirical assessments of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models under varied evaluation conditions.

Result: Significant fluctuations in benchmark results due to minor evaluation differences, observed across models.

Conclusion: A call for more rigorous evaluation paradigms to ensure reliable and reproducible model performance assessments.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic domain expertise in medical AI systems, ensuring reliable diagnostics.

Method: Develops a framework with hierarchical neural networks, ontology-guided VQA, and multimodal data integration using standardized medical terminology.

Result: The framework shows potential for broader application but awaits experimental validation due to resource constraints.

Conclusion: Future work will expand datasets and validate the system, aiming for broader clinical use.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

TL;DR: A novel model-based RL framework optimizes task performance and safety by dynamically switching between model-based planning and direct policy execution, using adaptive safety thresholds and an implicit world model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the safety and reliability challenges in RL for real-world applications, where model inaccuracies can lead to catastrophic failures.

Method: Proposes a framework with adaptive switching between planning and policy execution, dynamic safety thresholds, and an implicit world model to resolve objective mismatch.

Result: Outperforms non-adaptive methods, achieving robust performance on safety-critical tasks while optimizing both safety and performance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances safety and performance, demonstrating superiority over existing methods in safety-critical settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address increasingly complex cyber-attacks by modeling and simulating coordinated attacker-defender interactions in networked environments.

Method: Markovian modeling and simulation of cyber-attacker and defender agents on network nodes, with actions influencing system states and properties.

Result: Implemented a realistic scenario with varied behavior approaches for attackers and defenders, evaluating their impact on system goals.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical tool for studying dynamic cyber-defense strategies against coordinated attacks.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

TL;DR: A method for LLMs to control embodied agents by mapping observations to actions, refining strategies iteratively with feedback, validated on Gymnasium and MuJoCo tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs' symbolic reasoning for embodied agent control by integrating it with sensory-motor data.

Method: LLMs generate and iteratively refine control strategies using textual descriptions, performance feedback, and sensory-motor data.

Result: Successful identification of optimal or high-performing solutions in classic control tasks.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines symbolic reasoning with sub-symbolic data for embodied agent control.

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the critical alignment challenge of honesty in LLMs, especially those with CoT reasoning, which may intentionally deceive humans, unlike traditional hallucination issues.

Method: Uses representation engineering, Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT), and activation steering to induce, detect, and control deception in CoT-enabled LLMs.

Result: Achieves 89% detection accuracy for deception and a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate deception without explicit prompts.

Conclusion: The study reveals honesty-related issues in reasoning models and offers tools for trustworthy AI alignment, addressing strategic deception effectively.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Motivation: To bridge neural network adaptability with binary logic and localized processing, enabling programmable matter and robust computing systems.

Method: Uses differentiable logic gates in a circuit, trained end-to-end with gradients, operating discretely at inference.

Result: Successfully learns CA rules, generates patterns (e.g., checkerboard, lizard shape), and shows robustness to noise and damage.

Conclusion: DiffLogic CA advances programmable matter by combining DLGNs and NCA, offering adaptability, logic, and localized processing.

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful

Motivation: To create autonomous agents capable of self-regulation in resource-volatile environments, moving beyond reward-driven paradigms.

Method: Formalizes energy-based utility and viability constraints, integrating energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into a closed-loop system.

Result: Simulations show stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for deploying self-regulating autonomous agents in unpredictable, infrastructure-less settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

TL;DR: RAG-UAV improves LLMs' mathematical reasoning for UAV tasks using retrieval-augmented generation, boosting accuracy and reducing errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UAV control uses rigid equations, while LLMs lack reliability in math tasks. RAG-UAV aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes RAG-UAV, a framework enhancing LLMs with domain literature retrieval, tested on UAV-Math-Bench (20 problems).

Result: RAG improves exact answer accuracy (up to 75%), reduces formulation errors (25% to 5%), and lowers MSE significantly.

Conclusion: RAG enhances LLMs for UAV math tasks, but real-time flight control needs further study. Data is publicly available.

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes intrinsic metacognitive learning for self-improving agents to overcome rigidity and scalability issues, inspired by human metacognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improving agents lack flexibility and generalization, requiring a shift to intrinsic metacognitive learning for better adaptability.

Method: Introduces a framework with three components: metacognitive knowledge, planning, and evaluation, analyzing existing agents' reliance on extrinsic mechanisms.

Result: Existing agents use fixed, human-designed loops; intrinsic metacognition components are already present but underutilized.

Conclusion: Key challenges include distributing metacognitive responsibilities and robust evaluation to achieve sustained, generalized self-improvement.

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-First Search (LFS) is a novel LLM-guided search method that autonomously controls exploration, outperforming traditional search algorithms like MCTS, ToT-BFS, and BestFS in flexibility, efficiency, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional search methods like MCTS rely on fixed hyperparameters, limiting adaptability across tasks. LFS aims to eliminate this by leveraging LLMs for self-guided exploration.

Method: LFS empowers LLMs to autonomously decide search paths using internal scoring, removing the need for pre-defined strategies or manual tuning.

Result: LFS outperforms ToT-BFS, BestFS, and MCTS in challenging tasks, is more efficient, and scales better with stronger models and compute budgets.

Conclusion: LFS offers a flexible, efficient, and scalable alternative to traditional search methods, demonstrating superior performance without task-specific tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALP reduces token usage by 50% without performance drop by adapting generation length to problem difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods waste computation on easy problems or require manual tuning. ALP aims to optimize token usage dynamically.

Method: ALP uses reinforcement learning to penalize extra tokens inversely with a prompt's solve rate, favoring hard problems.

Result: ALP cuts average token usage by 50% while maintaining performance and improving accuracy on hard problems.

Conclusion: ALP intelligently redistributes compute, enhancing efficiency and performance on challenging tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

*Mikhail Terekhov, Zhen Ning David Liu, Caglar Gulcehre, Samuel Albanie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Control Tax' to quantify the cost of integrating AI control measures, providing a framework to balance safety and cost in AI oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust oversight in high-stakes AI applications drives the study of AI Control (AIC) and its practical adoption challenges.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical framework for Control Tax, evaluate language models in adversarial settings, and develop cost-effective monitoring strategies.

Result: The framework quantifies safety assurances and costs, offering optimized strategies for AI control in real-world deployments.

Conclusion: The work advances AIC by linking safety guarantees with economic feasibility, aiding practitioners in decision-making.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

TL;DR: AbdGen integrates logical reasoning with neural generative models for controllable, faithful, and generalizable visual generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving faithfulness, transparency, and generalizability in neural visual generative models by integrating logical reasoning.

Method: Uses vector-quantized symbol grounding and disentanglement training for controllability, plus logical abduction for minimal labeled data and rule induction.

Result: Successfully integrates neural generative models with logical reasoning, supporting learning from scratch or pre-trained models.

Conclusion: AbdGen enhances controllability and generalizability in visual generation, requiring few labeled data and enabling latent rule induction.

Abstract: Making neural visual generative models controllable by logical reasoning
systems is promising for improving faithfulness, transparency, and
generalizability. We propose the Abductive visual Generation (AbdGen) approach
to build such logic-integrated models. A vector-quantized symbol grounding
mechanism and the corresponding disentanglement training method are introduced
to enhance the controllability of logical symbols over generation. Furthermore,
we propose two logical abduction methods to make our approach require few
labeled training data and support the induction of latent logical generative
rules from data. We experimentally show that our approach can be utilized to
integrate various neural generative models with logical reasoning systems, by
both learning from scratch or utilizing pre-trained models directly. The code
is released at https://github.com/future-item/AbdGen.

### [380] [Can Graph Descriptive Order Affect Solving Graph Problems with LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07140)
*Yuyao Ge, Shenghua Liu, Baolong Bi, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Wenjie Feng, Lizhe Chen, Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines how the order of graph descriptions affects LLM performance in graph reasoning tasks, finding that ordered descriptions improve comprehension and robustness varies by task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph problems are complex and unique, but prior research overlooked the impact of prompt sequential order on LLM performance.

Method: Evaluated four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs.

Result: Ordered descriptions improve comprehension; robustness varies by task; performance impact relates to task characteristics.

Conclusion: Strategic graph description ordering can optimize LLM performance, advancing their application in graph-related problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in reasoning
tasks, including mathematical reasoning and logical deduction. Among these
reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique
structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers.
Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various
techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use
of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly
overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are
presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive
analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance.
Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across
six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1)
ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph
structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across
different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely
related to the inherent characteristics of tasks. This study provides a
critical advancement in the application of LLMs for solving graph-related
problems, paving the way for future research to optimize model performance
through strategic graph description ordering.

*Aditya Somasundaram, Pushkal Mishra, Ayon Borthakur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPELA is a resource-efficient learning algorithm that matches backpropagation's accuracy while using less memory, suitable for edge AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of traditional backpropagation in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Uses local loss functions for weight updates, avoiding gradient propagation and computational graph storage. Extended to train CNNs.

Result: Matches backpropagation performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets.

Conclusion: SPELA is promising for edge AI due to its efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a learning algorithm to overcome the limitations of traditional
backpropagation in resource-constrained environments: Solo Pass Embedded
Learning Algorithm (SPELA). SPELA operates with local loss functions to update
weights, significantly saving on resources allocated to the propagation of
gradients and storing computational graphs while being sufficiently accurate.
Consequently, SPELA can closely match backpropagation using less memory.
Moreover, SPELA can effectively fine-tune pre-trained image recognition models
for new tasks. Further, SPELA is extended with significant modifications to
train CNN networks, which we evaluate on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN 10
datasets, showing equivalent performance compared to backpropagation. Our
results indicate that SPELA, with its features such as local learning and early
exit, is a potential candidate for learning in resource-constrained edge AI
applications.

### [382] [Unleashing The Power of Pre-Trained Language Models for Irregularly Sampled Time Series](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08328)
*Weijia Zhang, Chenlong Yin, Hao Liu, Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for Irregularly Sampled Time Series (ISTS) analysis, proposing the ISTS-PLM framework to address unique challenges like uneven sampling and missing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PLM adaptations focus on Regularly Sampled Time Series (RSTS), leaving ISTS understudied despite their prevalence and challenges.

Method: The study investigates ISTS representation methods and introduces ISTS-PLM, a unified framework with time-aware and variable-aware PLMs for intra- and inter-time series modeling.

Result: ISTS-PLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks like classification, interpolation, and few-shot learning across healthcare, biomechanics, and climate science.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges the gap in PLM applications for ISTS, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness and versatility in diverse analytical scenarios.

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), such as ChatGPT, have significantly
advanced the field of natural language processing. This progress has inspired a
series of innovative studies that explore the adaptation of PLMs to time series
analysis, intending to create a unified foundation model that addresses various
time series analytical tasks. However, these efforts predominantly focus on
Regularly Sampled Time Series (RSTS), neglecting the unique challenges posed by
Irregularly Sampled Time Series (ISTS), which are characterized by uneven
sampling intervals and prevalent missing data. To bridge this gap, this work
takes the first step in exploring the potential of PLMs for ISTS analysis. We
begin by investigating the effect of various methods for representing ISTS,
aiming to maximize the efficacy of PLMs in the analysis. Furthermore, we
propose a unified PLM-based framework, named ISTS-PLM, to address diverse ISTS
analytical tasks. It integrates novel time-aware and variable-aware PLMs
tailored to tackle the intractable intra- and inter-time series modeling in
ISTS. Finally, extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate
that the ISTS-PLM, utilizing a structured and effective series-based
representation for ISTS, consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various analytical tasks, such as classification, interpolation,
extrapolation, few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios, spanning scientific
domains like healthcare, biomechanics, and climate science.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EnIGMA is an LM agent for solving CTF challenges, introducing new tools and interfaces to improve vulnerability exploitation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited success of LM agents in cybersecurity prompts the development of EnIGMA for CTF challenges.

Method: Introduces Interactive Agent Tools for running utilities like debuggers and server connection tools.

Result: Empirical analysis on 390 CTF challenges shows improved performance, achieving top results on benchmarks.

Conclusion: EnIGMA advances LM agent capabilities in cybersecurity, with tools and methods addressing data leakage and soliloquizing.

Abstract: Although language model (LM) agents have demonstrated increased performance
in multiple domains, including coding and web-browsing, their success in
cybersecurity has been limited. We present EnIGMA, an LM agent for autonomously
solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. We introduce new tools and
interfaces to improve the agent's ability to find and exploit security
vulnerabilities, focusing on interactive terminal programs. These novel
Interactive Agent Tools enable LM agents, for the first time, to run
interactive utilities, such as a debugger and a server connection tool, which
are essential for solving these challenges. Empirical analysis on 390 CTF
challenges across four benchmarks demonstrate that these new tools and
interfaces substantially improve our agent's performance, achieving
state-of-the-art results on NYU CTF, Intercode-CTF, and CyBench. Finally, we
analyze data leakage, developing new methods to quantify it and identifying a
new phenomenon we term soliloquizing, where the model self-generates
hallucinated observations without interacting with the environment. Our code
and development dataset are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ontology embeddings map classes, relations, and individuals in ontologies
into $\mathbb{R}^n$, and within $\mathbb{R}^n$ similarity between entities can
be computed or new axioms inferred. For ontologies in the Description Logic
$\mathcal{EL}^{++}$, several optimization-based embedding methods have been
developed that explicitly generate models of an ontology. However, these
methods suffer from some limitations; they do not distinguish between
statements that are unprovable and provably false, and therefore they may use
entailed statements as negatives. Furthermore, they do not utilize the
deductive closure of an ontology to identify statements that are inferred but
not asserted. We evaluated a set of embedding methods for $\mathcal{EL}^{++}$
ontologies, incorporating several modifications that aim to make use of the
ontology deductive closure. In particular, we designed novel negative losses
that account both for the deductive closure and different types of negatives
and formulated evaluation methods for knowledge base completion. We demonstrate
that our embedding methods improve over the baseline ontology embedding in the
task of knowledge base or ontology completion.

*Temurbek Rahmatullaev, Polina Druzhinina, Nikita Kurdiukov, Matvey Mikhalchuk, Andrey Kuznetsov, Anton Razzhigaev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A universal adversarial attack on multimodal LLMs uses a single optimized image to bypass alignment safeguards, achieving high success rates and cross-model universality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in multimodal LLMs by crafting adversarial images that override safety measures and produce targeted or unsafe responses.

Method: Backpropagates through the vision encoder and language head to create a synthetic image that forces specific or harmful outputs.

Result: Achieves higher attack success rates (up to 81%) than text-only baselines and demonstrates cross-model universality.

Conclusion: Highlights critical vulnerabilities in multimodal alignment and calls for stronger adversarial defenses.

Abstract: We propose a universal adversarial attack on multimodal Large Language Models
(LLMs) that leverages a single optimized image to override alignment safeguards
across diverse queries and even multiple models. By backpropagating through the
vision encoder and language head, we craft a synthetic image that forces the
model to respond with a targeted phrase (e.g., "Sure, here it is") or otherwise
unsafe content -- even for harmful prompts. In experiments on the SafeBench and
MM-SafetyBench benchmarks, our method achieves higher attack success rates than
existing baselines, including text-only universal prompts (e.g., up to 81% on
certain models). We further demonstrate cross-model universality by training on
several multimodal LLMs simultaneously. Additionally, a multi-answer variant of
our approach produces more natural-sounding (yet still malicious) responses.
These findings underscore critical vulnerabilities in current multimodal
alignment and call for more robust adversarial defenses. We will release code
and datasets under the Apache-2.0 license. Warning: some content generated by
Multimodal LLMs in this paper may be offensive.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the '2D-Cheating' problem in 3D LLM evaluation, where VLMs solve tasks using rendered images, undermining true 3D capability assessment. It proposes principles for better evaluation and advocates separating 3D abilities from 1D/2D aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ineffective evaluation of 3D LLMs' unique capabilities due to VLMs exploiting rendered images, exposing a gap in current benchmarks.

Method: Tested VLM performance on 3D LLM benchmarks and used the results to propose improved evaluation principles.

Result: Identified the '2D-Cheating' problem and provided guidelines for more accurate 3D LLM assessment.

Conclusion: Better evaluation methods are needed to isolate and measure genuine 3D understanding in LLMs, with clear separation from 1D/2D aspects.

Abstract: In this work, we identify the "2D-Cheating" problem in 3D LLM evaluation,
where these tasks might be easily solved by VLMs with rendered images of point
clouds, exposing ineffective evaluation of 3D LLMs' unique 3D capabilities. We
test VLM performance across multiple 3D LLM benchmarks and, using this as a
reference, propose principles for better assessing genuine 3D understanding. We

TL;DR: EmbodiedBench is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate vision-driven embodied agents using MLLMs, revealing strengths in high-level tasks but weaknesses in low-level manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks for MLLM-based embodied agents, enabling better development and assessment.

Method: Developed EmbodiedBench with 1,128 tasks across four environments and six subsets to evaluate key agent capabilities.

Result: MLLMs perform well on high-level tasks but poorly on low-level manipulation, with GPT-4o scoring only 28.9% on average.

Conclusion: EmbodiedBench serves as a standardized platform to identify challenges and guide advancements in MLLM-based embodied agents.

Abstract: Leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to create embodied
agents offers a promising avenue for tackling real-world tasks. While
language-centric embodied agents have garnered substantial attention,
MLLM-based embodied agents remain underexplored due to the lack of
comprehensive evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
EmbodiedBench, an extensive benchmark designed to evaluate vision-driven
embodied agents. EmbodiedBench features: (1) a diverse set of 1,128 testing
tasks across four environments, ranging from high-level semantic tasks (e.g.,
household) to low-level tasks involving atomic actions (e.g., navigation and
manipulation); and (2) six meticulously curated subsets evaluating essential
agent capabilities like commonsense reasoning, complex instruction
understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-term planning.
Through extensive experiments, we evaluated 24 leading proprietary and
open-source MLLMs within EmbodiedBench. Our findings reveal that: MLLMs excel
at high-level tasks but struggle with low-level manipulation, with the best
model, GPT-4o, scoring only 28.9\% on average. EmbodiedBench provides a
multifaceted standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing
challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance MLLM-based embodied
agents. Our code and dataset are available at https://embodiedbench.github.io.

*Fengxiang Cheng, Haoxuan Li, Fenrong Liu, Robert van Rooij, Kun Zhang, Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights challenges in LLMs' logical reasoning, categorizing them into question-answering failures and logical inconsistencies, and reviews methods, taxonomies, and future directions to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs in logical reasoning, particularly in complex question answering and maintaining logical consistency.

Method: The paper reviews cutting-edge methods, categorizing them by reliance on external solvers, prompts, and fine-tuning, and discusses solutions for various logical consistencies.

Result: A comprehensive taxonomy of methods and solutions for improving LLMs' logical reasoning, along with benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on extending to modal logic for uncertainty and developing algorithms for multiple logical consistencies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various
tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant
challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs, which can be categorized
into the following two aspects: (1) Logical question answering: LLMs often fail
to generate the correct answer within a complex logical problem which requires
sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of
premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency: LLMs are prone to producing
responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a
state-of-the-art question-answering LLM Macaw, answers Yes to both questions Is
a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie
have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively
investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose a detailed taxonomy.
Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods
can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, and
fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions
of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation,
transitivity, factuality consistencies, and their composites. In addition, we
review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss
promising research directions, such as extending to modal logic to account for
uncertainty and developing efficient algorithms that simultaneously satisfy
multiple logical consistencies.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between fast, heuristic-based decisions (System 1) and slower, logical reasoning (System 2) in LLMs, aiming for human-like cognitive abilities.

Method: The survey reviews foundational LLMs, explores the development of reasoning LLMs, analyzes their features and core methods, and benchmarks their performance.

Result: Recent reasoning LLMs (e.g., OpenAI's o1/o3, DeepSeek's R1) show expert-level performance in fields like math and coding, mimicking System 2 reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper serves as a resource to inspire innovation in reasoning LLMs, with a GitHub repository tracking ongoing developments.

Abstract: Achieving human-level intelligence requires refining the transition from the
fast, intuitive System 1 to the slower, more deliberate System 2 reasoning.
While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical
reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large
Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for
complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step
analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs
like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level
performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the
deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities.
This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs
and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their
combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to
construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling
advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally,
we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison
of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore
promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time

*Yubo Zhao, Qi Wu, Yifan Wang, Yu-Wing Tai, Chi-Keung Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper enhances LLM-powered motion agents for autonomous navigation in complex, dynamic environments, outperforming prior limited studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the constraints of earlier work on LLMs' spatial reasoning, which was limited to simple, static settings with single agents.

Method: Uses LLMs as spatial reasoners by encoding environments, agents, and paths as discrete tokens, enabling multi-agent coordination and dynamic obstacle avoidance without retraining.

Result: LLMs generalize across agents, tasks, and environments via text-based interactions, enabling semantically grounded navigation.

Conclusion: The framework opens new possibilities for interactive navigation in simulation and embodied systems.

Abstract: This paper advances motion agents empowered by large language models (LLMs)
toward autonomous navigation in dynamic and cluttered environments,
significantly surpassing first and recent seminal but limited studies on LLM's
spatial reasoning, where movements are restricted in four directions in simple,
static environments in the presence of only single agents much less multiple
agents. Specifically, we investigate LLMs as spatial reasoners to overcome
these limitations by uniformly encoding environments (e.g., real indoor
floorplans), agents which can be dynamic obstacles and their paths as discrete
tokens akin to language tokens. Our training-free framework supports
multi-agent coordination, closed-loop replanning, and dynamic obstacle
avoidance without retraining or fine-tuning. We show that LLMs can generalize
across agents, tasks, and environments using only text-based interactions,
opening new possibilities for semantically grounded, interactive navigation in
both simulation and embodied systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T2DA is a framework for offline meta-RL that uses natural language to supervise learning, enabling zero-shot text-to-decision generation without costly pre-acquired signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of traditional offline meta-RL methods that rely on expensive or infeasible supervision signals for unseen tasks.

Method: Introduces a generalized world model for multi-task decision data and uses contrastive language-decision pre-training to align text embeddings with dynamics.

Result: T2DA outperforms baselines in zero-shot generalization on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks.

Conclusion: T2DA provides a scalable and effective solution for leveraging natural language in offline meta-RL.

Abstract: Offline meta-RL usually tackles generalization by inferring task beliefs from
high-quality samples or warmup explorations. The restricted form limits their
generality and usability since these supervision signals are expensive and even
infeasible to acquire in advance for unseen tasks. Learning directly from the
raw text about decision tasks is a promising alternative to leverage a much
broader source of supervision. In the paper, we propose
\textbf{T}ext-to-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{A}gent (\textbf{T2DA}), a simple and
scalable framework that supervises offline meta-RL with natural language. We
first introduce a generalized world model to encode multi-task decision data
into a dynamics-aware embedding space. Then, inspired by CLIP, we predict which
textual description goes with which decision embedding, effectively bridging
their semantic gap via contrastive language-decision pre-training and aligning
the text embeddings to comprehend the environment dynamics. After training the
text-conditioned generalist policy, the agent can directly realize zero-shot
text-to-decision generation in response to language instructions. Comprehensive
experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that T2DA facilitates
high-capacity zero-shot generalization and outperforms various types of
baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/NJU-RL/T2DA.

TL;DR: Aerial+ is a neurosymbolic ARM method that reduces rule explosion in high-dimensional datasets, achieving concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional datasets in ARM lead to excessive rules, increasing execution time and degrading performance, necessitating a solution to manage rule explosion.

Method: Aerial+ uses an under-complete autoencoder to create neural data representations, extracting rules via the model's reconstruction mechanism.

Result: Evaluations on five datasets show Aerial+ outperforms seven baselines, producing concise, high-quality rule sets with full coverage and reduced execution time.

Conclusion: Aerial+ effectively addresses rule explosion in ARM, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in rule-based interpretable machine learning models.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of mining patterns among data
features in the form of logical rules, with applications across a myriad of
domains. However, high-dimensional datasets often result in an excessive number
of rules, increasing execution time and negatively impacting downstream task
performance. Managing this rule explosion remains a central challenge in ARM
research. To address this, we introduce Aerial+, a novel neurosymbolic ARM
method. Aerial+ leverages an under-complete autoencoder to create a neural
representation of the data, capturing associations between features. It
extracts rules from this neural representation by exploiting the model's
reconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five datasets against seven
baselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art results by
learning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage. When
integrated into rule-based interpretable machine learning models, Aerial+
significantly reduces execution time while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models to predict lithium-ion battery capacity degradation with zero-shot generalization. It also introduces a knowledge distillation framework to transfer foundation model knowledge into compact expert models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate battery capacity degradation estimation is crucial for reliability and safety, but traditional expert models are scenario-specific, and general-purpose foundation models for this task are underexplored.

Method: A degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy is applied to the Timer model using 10 GB of battery data. A knowledge distillation framework transfers foundation model knowledge to expert models.

Result: The fine-tuned Battery-Timer shows strong zero-shot generalization in capacity degradation forecasting. Knowledge distillation improves expert models' multi-condition generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance battery degradation prediction and enable efficient deployment of large models via knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical
for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional
expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations.
With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of
general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However,
foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain
largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation
prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a
degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We
apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of
open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released
CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer
possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation
forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models,
we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the
knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models.
Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models
confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the
multi-condition generalization of expert models.

*Lingxiao Du, Fanqing Meng, Zongkai Liu, Zhixiang Zhou, Ping Luo, Qiaosheng Zhang, Wenqi Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MM-PRM enhances multimodal reasoning by using a process reward model with automated step-level annotations, improving logical consistency and performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with complex multi-step reasoning due to lack of fine-grained supervision over intermediate steps.

Method: Proposes MM-PRM, trained using MM-Policy and MM-K12 dataset, with MCTS-based pipeline for step-level annotations.

Result: Achieves significant improvements on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, confirming effectiveness of soft labels and path diversity.

Conclusion: Process supervision enhances logical robustness in multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive
progress in vision-language understanding, they still struggle with complex
multi-step reasoning, often producing logically inconsistent or partially
correct solutions. A key limitation lies in the lack of fine-grained
supervision over intermediate reasoning steps. To address this, we propose
MM-PRM, a process reward model trained within a fully automated, scalable
framework. We first build MM-Policy, a strong multimodal model trained on
diverse mathematical reasoning data. Then, we construct MM-K12, a curated
dataset of 10,000 multimodal math problems with verifiable answers, which
serves as seed data. Leveraging a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based
pipeline, we generate over 700k step-level annotations without human labeling.
The resulting PRM is used to score candidate reasoning paths in the Best-of-N
inference setup and achieves significant improvements across both in-domain
(MM-K12 test set) and out-of-domain (OlympiadBench, MathVista, etc.)
benchmarks. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of soft labels, smaller
learning rates, and path diversity in optimizing PRM performance. MM-PRM
demonstrates that process supervision is a powerful tool for enhancing the
logical robustness of multimodal reasoning systems. We release all our codes
and data at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-PRM.

### [395] [Bandit based Dynamic Candidate Edge Selection in Solving Traveling Salesman Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15862)
*Long Wang, Jiongzhi Zheng, Zhengda Xiong, ChuMin Li, Kun He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic candidate edge selection method using multi-armed bandit models to improve the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm for TSP, enhancing solution quality and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms like LKH use static candidate edges, leading to local optima traps and limiting solution quality.

Method: Incorporates multi-armed bandit models to dynamically select promising candidate edges during iterations.

Result: Experiments show improved performance on TSP benchmarks and enhanced LKH-3 for TSP variants.

Conclusion: The dynamic edge selection method significantly boosts LKH and LKH-3 performance, offering better solutions.

Abstract: Algorithms designed for routing problems typically rely on high-quality
candidate edges to guide their search, aiming to reduce the search space and
enhance the search efficiency. However, many existing algorithms, like the
classical Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP), often use predetermined candidate edges that remain static
throughout local searches. This rigidity could cause the algorithm to get
trapped in local optima, limiting its potential to find better solutions. To
address this issue, we propose expanding the candidate sets to include other
promising edges, providing them an opportunity for selection. Specifically, we
incorporate multi-armed bandit models to dynamically select the most suitable
candidate edges in each iteration, enabling LKH to make smarter choices and
lead to improved solutions. Extensive experiments on multiple TSP benchmarks
show the excellent performance of our method. Moreover, we employ this
bandit-based method to LKH-3, an extension of LKH tailored for solving various
TSP variant problems, and our method also significantly enhances LKH-3's
performance across typical TSP variants.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework called Generative Collective Intelligence (GCI) combines human and AI strengths to solve complex problems, leveraging AI as interactive agents and knowledge organizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of purely algorithmic approaches by integrating human creativity and AI's computational power for societal challenges.

Method: GCI uses AI in dual roles: interactive agents and knowledge organizers, based on mathematical principles like the law of comparative judgment.

Result: GCI enables structured collaboration across domains like climate adaptation, healthcare, and civic participation.

Conclusion: GCI offers a promising approach to solving complex societal challenges by combining human and AI capabilities.

Abstract: We propose a general framework for human-AI collaboration that amplifies the
distinct capabilities of both types of intelligence. We refer to this as
Generative Collective Intelligence (GCI). GCI employs AI in dual roles: as
interactive agents and as technology that accumulates, organizes, and leverages
knowledge. In this second role, AI creates a cognitive bridge between human
reasoning and AI models. The AI functions as a social and cultural technology
that enables groups to solve complex problems through structured collaboration
that transcends traditional communication barriers. We argue that GCI can
overcome limitations of purely algorithmic approaches to problem-solving and
decision-making. We describe the mathematical foundations of GCI, based on the
law of comparative judgment and minimum regret principles, and briefly
illustrate its applications across various domains, including climate
adaptation, healthcare transformation, and civic participation. By combining
human creativity with AI's computational capabilities, GCI offers a promising
approach to addressing complex societal challenges that neither humans nor
machines can solve alone.

*Zihao Zeng, Xuyao Huang, Boxiu Li, Hao Zhang, Zhijie Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MinD introduces Multi-Turn Decomposition to streamline Chain-of-Thought reasoning in Large Reasoning Models, reducing latency and token usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of lengthy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which suffer from high latency and lack explicit control over reasoning units.

Method: Proposes Multi-Turn Decomposition (MinD), converting CoT into structured, turn-wise interactions. Uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to train models, prioritizing fewer turns with correct outputs.

Result: Achieves ~70% reduction in output tokens and time to first token (TTFT) while maintaining competitive performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: MinD effectively improves efficiency and control in LRMs without sacrificing reasoning accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are criticized for the excessively lengthy
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to derive the final answer, suffering from high
first-token and overall latency. Typically, the CoT of LRMs mixes multiple
thinking units; each unit attempts to produce a candidate answer to the
original query. Hence, a natural idea to improve efficiency is to reduce the
unit number. Yet, the fact that the thinking units in vanilla CoT cannot be
explicitly managed renders doing so challenging. This paper introduces
Multi-Turn Decomposition (MinD) to decode conventional CoT into a sequence of
explicit, structured, and turn-wise interactions to bridge the gap. In MinD,
the model provides a multi-turn response to the query, where each turn embraces
a thinking unit and yields a corresponding answer. The subsequent turns can
reflect, verify, revise, or explore alternative approaches to both the thinking
and answer parts of earlier ones. This not only makes the answer delivered more
swiftly, but also enables explicit controls over the iterative reasoning
process (i.e., users may halt or continue at any turn). We follow a supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) then reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to realize MinD. We
first rephrase the outputs of an LRM into multi-turn formats by prompting
another LLM, and then tune the LRM with such data. Observing that the tuned
model tends to consume even more tokens than the original one (probably due to
that the multi-turn formats introduce additional answer tokens), we advocate
leveraging RL algorithms like GRPO to prioritize correct outputs with fewer
turns. Trained on the MATH dataset using R1-Distill models, MinD can achieve up
to ~70% reduction in both output token usage and time to first token (TTFT),
while maintaining competitive performance on reasoning benchmarks such as
MATH-500, AIME24, AMC23, and GPQA-Diamond.

*Zikang Guo, Benfeng Xu, Xiaorui Wang, Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIRROR is a framework enhancing LLMs' reflection capabilities by introducing intra-reflection (pre-action) and inter-reflection (post-action), improving error correction in multi-agent workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reflection methods in LLMs only occur post-action, missing opportunities to prevent errors before execution. MIRROR aims to address this gap by enabling pre-action reflection.

Method: MIRROR combines intra-reflection (pre-action evaluation) and inter-reflection (post-action adjustment) to systematically correct errors in agent workflows.

Result: MIRROR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench and TravelPlanner benchmarks, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: MIRROR's dual-reflection approach significantly enhances LLMs' ability to prevent and correct errors, advancing multi-agent workflow performance.

Abstract: Complex tasks involving tool integration pose significant challenges for
Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to the emergence of multi-agent workflows
as a promising solution. Reflection has emerged as an effective strategy for
correcting erroneous trajectories in agentic workflows. However, existing
approaches only exploit such capability in the post-action stage, where the
agent observes the execution outcomes. We argue that, like humans, LLMs can
also engage in reflection before action execution: the agent can anticipate
undesirable outcomes from its own decisions, which not only provides a
necessarily complementary perspective to evaluate the decision but also
prevents the propagation of errors throughout the trajectory. In this paper, we
propose MIRROR, a framework that consists of both intra-reflection, which
critically assesses intended actions before execution, and inter-reflection,
which further adjusts the trajectory based on observations. This design
systematically leverages LLM reflection capabilities to eliminate and rectify
erroneous actions on a more comprehensive scope. Evaluations on both the
StableToolBench and TravelPlanner benchmarks demonstrate MIRROR's superior
performance, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to existing
approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: E^2GraphRAG improves efficiency and effectiveness over GraphRAG by using a summary tree and entity graph with adaptive retrieval, achieving faster indexing and retrieval speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based RAG methods like GraphRAG are inefficient and rely on manual query modes, limiting practicality.

Method: E^2GraphRAG constructs a summary tree with LLMs and an entity graph with SpaCy, then uses bidirectional indexes for fast retrieval. An adaptive strategy selects between local and global retrieval modes.

Result: E^2GraphRAG achieves 10x faster indexing than GraphRAG and 100x speedup over LightRAG in retrieval, with competitive QA performance.

Conclusion: E^2GraphRAG offers a more efficient and effective graph-based RAG framework, addressing limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Graph-based RAG methods like GraphRAG have shown promising global
understanding of the knowledge base by constructing hierarchical entity graphs.
However, they often suffer from inefficiency and rely on manually pre-defined
query modes, limiting practical use. In this paper, we propose E^2GraphRAG, a
streamlined graph-based RAG framework that improves both Efficiency and
Effectiveness. During the indexing stage, E^2GraphRAG constructs a summary tree
with large language models and an entity graph with SpaCy based on document
chunks. We then construct bidirectional indexes between entities and chunks to
capture their many-to-many relationships, enabling fast lookup during both
local and global retrieval. For the retrieval stage, we design an adaptive
retrieval strategy that leverages the graph structure to retrieve and select
between local and global modes. Experiments show that E^2GraphRAG achieves up
to 10 times faster indexing than GraphRAG and 100 times speedup over LightRAG
in retrieval while maintaining competitive QA performance.

*Augusto Mondelli, Yueshan Li, Alessandro Zanardi, Emilio Frazzoli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An automated method for generating realistic, safety-critical human behaviors to evaluate AV planners using goal positions and Bayesian optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing AV planner robustness against human behavior uncertainty is critical for safe deployment, but current data-driven methods lack comprehensive testing capabilities.

Method: Parameterizes human behaviors with goal positions, uses ProSim for simulation, and employs Bayesian optimization to automate safety-critical test generation.

Result: Effectively generates diverse, realistic driving behaviors for AV planner evaluation across varying scenarios.

Conclusion: The method efficiently produces comprehensive tests for AV planners, enhancing their evaluation in interactive settings.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle (AV) planners must undergo rigorous evaluation before
widespread deployment on public roads, particularly to assess their robustness
against the uncertainty of human behaviors. While recent advancements in
data-driven scenario generation enable the simulation of realistic human
behaviors in interactive settings, leveraging these models to construct
comprehensive tests for AV planners remains an open challenge. In this work, we
introduce an automated method to efficiently generate realistic and
safety-critical human behaviors for AV planner evaluation in interactive
scenarios. We parameterize complex human behaviors using low-dimensional goal
positions, which are then fed into a promptable traffic simulator, ProSim, to
guide the behaviors of simulated agents. To automate test generation, we
introduce a prompt generation module that explores the goal domain and
efficiently identifies safety-critical behaviors using Bayesian optimization.
We apply our method to the evaluation of an optimization-based planner and
demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in automatically generating
diverse and realistic driving behaviors across scenarios with varying initial
conditions.

*Haichen Wang, Liu Yang, Xinyuan Zhang, Haomin Yu, Ming Li, Jilin Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes ADFormer, a model for passenger demand forecasting that improves spatio-temporal correlation capture by integrating high-level correlations with original ones using Differential Attention and aggregation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for passenger demand forecasting fail to fully adapt to complex spatio-temporal correlations and overlook high-level correlations, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The ADFormer model uses Differential Attention to capture original spatial correlations and denoise attention, along with distinct aggregation strategies for space and time to unify original and high-level correlations.

Result: Experiments on taxi and bike datasets show ADFormer's effectiveness and efficiency, confirming its practical value.

Conclusion: ADFormer successfully integrates high-level correlations with original ones, improving demand forecasting and demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Passenger demand forecasting helps optimize vehicle scheduling, thereby
improving urban efficiency. Recently, attention-based methods have been used to
adequately capture the dynamic nature of spatio-temporal data. However,
existing methods that rely on heuristic masking strategies cannot fully adapt
to the complex spatio-temporal correlations, hindering the model from focusing
on the right context. These works also overlook the high-level correlations
that exist in the real world. Effectively integrating these high-level
correlations with the original correlations is crucial. To fill this gap, we
propose the Aggregation Differential Transformer (ADFormer), which offers new
insights to demand forecasting promotion. Specifically, we utilize Differential
Attention to capture the original spatial correlations and achieve attention
denoising. Meanwhile, we design distinct aggregation strategies based on the
nature of space and time. Then, the original correlations are unified with the
high-level correlations, enabling the model to capture holistic spatio-temporal
relations. Experiments conducted on taxi and bike datasets confirm the
effectiveness and efficiency of our model, demonstrating its practical value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI benchmarks lack macOS coverage, despite its unique patterns and exclusive apps, and are mostly English-only. macOSWorld addresses these gaps.

Method: Developed macOSWorld with 202 multilingual tasks across 30 apps (28 macOS-exclusive), including safety benchmarking. Evaluated six GUI agents.

Result: Proprietary agents achieved >30% success, while open-source models lagged at <2%. Multilingual tasks showed 27.5% degradation in Arabic. Safety vulnerabilities were exposed.

Conclusion: macOSWorld highlights the need for macOS domain adaptation and improved multilingual support. Safety benchmarking underscores the urgency of addressing deception attacks.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show promising capabilities for
automating computer-use tasks and facilitating accessibility, but existing
interactive benchmarks are mostly English-only, covering web-use or Windows,
Linux, and Android environments, but not macOS. macOS is a major OS with
distinctive GUI patterns and exclusive applications. To bridge the gaps, we
present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents
on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30
applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces
offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As
GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also
includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI
agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above
30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below
2%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks
also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 27.5% average
degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also
highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate
attention. macOSWorld is available at https://github.com/showlab/macosworld.

*Emiliano Acevedo, Martín Rocamora, Magdalena Fuentes*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Audio-text models struggle with background noise in sound classification. A new method improves performance by integrating background contributions without retraining, also addressing the audio-text embedding gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-text models perform poorly with background noise, limiting their practical use in real-world environments.

Method: Proposes quantifying and integrating background sound contributions into classification and narrowing the audio-text embedding gap.

Result: Improved classification accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions, generalizing well across prototypical approaches.

Conclusion: The method enhances robustness and scalability of audio-text models in diverse environments without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating time-localized explanations in audio classification models is proposed, using event time annotations as ground truth. The benchmark helps optimize and compare post-hoc explanation methods, achieving near-perfect results in some cases, and reveals spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern audio processing models lack transparency, making explanations for their decisions valuable for insights and trust. However, evaluating explanation quality is challenging due to the absence of ground truth.

Method: Proposes a benchmark using time annotations of target events as proxy ground truth for evaluating explanations. Systematically optimizes and compares model-agnostic post-hoc explanation methods.

Result: Some methods achieve close to perfect explanations. The benchmark also helps uncover spurious correlations in the data.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark effectively evaluates and improves explanation methods for audio classification, enhancing model transparency and trust.

Abstract: Most modern approaches for audio processing are opaque, in the sense that
they do not provide an explanation for their decisions. For this reason,
various methods have been proposed to explain the outputs generated by these
models. Good explanations can result in interesting insights about the data or
the model, as well as increase trust in the system. Unfortunately, evaluating
the quality of explanations is far from trivial since, for most tasks, there is
no clear ground truth explanation to use as reference. In this work, we propose
a benchmark for time-localized explanations for audio classification models
that uses time annotations of target events as a proxy for ground truth
explanations. We use this benchmark to systematically optimize and compare
various approaches for model-agnostic post-hoc explanation, obtaining, in some
cases, close to perfect explanations. Finally, we illustrate the utility of the
explanations for uncovering spurious correlations.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A model improves phonemic/prosodic label coherence with graphemes using implicit and explicit conditioning, enhancing downstream tasks like TTS and accent estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of coherence between graphemes and phonemic/prosodic labels in speech, which limits downstream task performance.

Method: 1) Implicit grapheme conditioning via BERT-based prompt encoder. 2) Explicit pruning of label hypotheses inconsistent with graphemes during inference.

Result: Improved grapheme-label consistency and enhanced performance in accent estimation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges grapheme-label coherence, benefiting applications like TTS and accent estimation.

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Proposes LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme decoding for phoneme-based ASR, outperforming WFST-based systems with 3.6% and 6.9% WER reductions for Polish and German.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phoneme-based multilingual pre-training is data-efficient but limited by WFST decoding's complexity and inability to leverage LLMs.

Method: Introduces LLM-P2G decoding with S2P and P2G, addressing information loss via DANP and TKM training strategies.

Result: LLM-P2G achieves relative WER reductions of 3.6% (Polish) and 6.9% (German) over WFST-based systems.

Conclusion: LLM-P2G is effective for crosslingual ASR, offering improved performance and addressing limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

*Vishwa Mohan Singh, Sai Anirudh Aryasomayajula, Ahan Chatterjee, Beste Aydemir, Rifat Mehreen Amin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a human-computation approach to improve AI music generation by incorporating user feedback via a genetic algorithm, showing iterative performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI music generation models lack personalization due to fixed datasets, making user input interpretation challenging.

Method: A genetic algorithm aggregates user ratings as a loss function to fine-tune the model iteratively.

Result: Pilot tests showed rating increases of 0.2 (first iteration) and 0.39 (second iteration) over baseline.

Conclusion: The human-computation approach effectively enhances AI music generation by leveraging user feedback.

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: STOPA is a new dataset for deepfake speech source tracing, offering systematic variation and rich metadata to improve attribution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack systematic variation and metadata, limiting progress in deepfake speech source tracing.

Method: Introduces STOPA, a dataset with 700k samples from 13 synthesisers, covering 8 AMs, 6 VMs, and diverse parameters.

Result: Provides a controlled framework for higher attribution reliability in forensic analysis and deepfake detection.

Conclusion: STOPA enhances deepfake speech source tracing by addressing dataset limitations, improving accuracy and transparency.

Abstract: A key research area in deepfake speech detection is source tracing -
determining the origin of synthesised utterances. The approaches may involve
identifying the acoustic model (AM), vocoder model (VM), or other
generation-specific parameters. However, progress is limited by the lack of a
dedicated, systematically curated dataset. To address this, we introduce STOPA,
a systematically varied and metadata-rich dataset for deepfake speech source
tracing, covering 8 AMs, 6 VMs, and diverse parameter settings across 700k
samples from 13 distinct synthesisers. Unlike existing datasets, which often
feature limited variation or sparse metadata, STOPA provides a systematically
controlled framework covering a broader range of generative factors, such as
the choice of the vocoder model, acoustic model, or pretrained weights,
ensuring higher attribution reliability. This control improves attribution
accuracy, aiding forensic analysis, deepfake detection, and generative model
transparency.

Motivation: Address the complexity and reliance on large models in current audio steganography methods by proposing a simpler, fixed decoder approach with adversarial perturbations.

Method: Uses adversarial perturbations to embed secret messages in audio and a lightweight fixed decoder for extraction, ensuring perceptual and statistical similarity to cover audio.

Result: FGAS achieves a 10 dB PSNR gain and 2% higher classification error rate under high-capacity embedding, outperforming SOTA methods.

Conclusion: FGAS offers a simpler, more effective solution for audio steganography with improved quality and resistance to steganalysis.

Abstract: The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has
made high-fidelity generated audio widely available across the Internet,
providing diverse cover signals for covert communication. Driven by advances in
deep learning, current audio steganography schemes are mainly based on
encoding-decoding network architectures. While these methods greatly improve
the security of audio steganography, they typically require complex training
and large pre-trained models. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper
pioneers a Fixed Decoder Network-Based Audio Steganography with Adversarial
Perturbation Generation (FGAS). Adversarial perturbations carrying secret
message are embedded into the cover audio to generate stego audio. The receiver
only needs to share the structure and weights of the fixed decoder network to
accurately extract the secret message from the stego audio, this eliminates the
reliance on large pre-trained models. In FGAS, we propose an audio Adversarial
Perturbation Generation (APG) strategy and design a lightweight fixed decoder.
The fixed decoder guarantees reliable extraction of the hidden message, while
the adversarial perturbations are optimized to keep the stego audio
perceptually and statistically close to the cover audio, thereby improving
resistance to steganalysis. The experimental results show that FGAS
significantly improves the quality of stego audio, achieving an average PSNR
gain of over 10 dB compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, FGAS exhibits superior
anti-steganalysis performance under different relative payloads; under
high-capacity embedding, it achieves a classification error rate about 2%
higher, indicating stronger anti-steganalysis performance compared to current
SOTA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore if pretrained diffusion models, designed for audio generation, can inherently perform language-queried audio source separation without further training.

Method: Introduces Diffusion-Guided Mask Optimization (DGMO), a test-time optimization framework refining spectrogram masks for precise separation.

Result: Effectively repurposes pretrained diffusion models for source separation, achieving competitive performance without supervision.

Conclusion: Expands diffusion models' applications beyond generation, establishing a zero-shot audio separation paradigm.

Abstract: Language-queried Audio Source Separation (LASS) enables open-vocabulary sound
separation via natural language queries. While existing methods rely on
task-specific training, we explore whether pretrained diffusion models,
originally designed for audio generation, can inherently perform separation
without further training. In this study, we introduce a training-free framework
leveraging generative priors for zero-shot LASS. Analyzing naive adaptations,
we identify key limitations arising from modality-specific challenges. To
address these issues, we propose Diffusion-Guided Mask Optimization (DGMO), a
test-time optimization framework that refines spectrogram masks for precise,
input-aligned separation. Our approach effectively repurposes pretrained
diffusion models for source separation, achieving competitive performance
without task-specific supervision. This work expands the application of
diffusion models beyond generation, establishing a new paradigm for zero-shot
audio separation. The code is available at: https://wltschmrz.github.io/DGMO/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing adoption of Concept-based Models in sensitive domains by identifying their limitations and improving their reliability and trustworthiness.

Method: Comprehensive survey aggregating challenges and mitigation strategies for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms, along with recent advances.

Result: Identified key issues like concept leakage and entangled representations, and discussed architectural choices to mitigate them.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for further research to enhance the robustness and real-world applicability of Concept-based Models.

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detectors rely on statistical models, lacking explainability. The work aims to integrate probabilistic reasoning via MLNs for better performance and transparency.

Method: Augment existing OOD detectors with MLNs, which combine first-order logic and probabilistic reasoning. A simple algorithm for learning logical constraints from data is introduced.

Result: MLNs significantly improve OOD detection performance across multiple datasets while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MLNs offer a promising approach to enhance OOD detection, balancing performance, efficiency, and explainability.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

*Warayut Dokduea, Weerachart Tangchirapat, Sompote Youwai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for concrete creep prediction, outperforming traditional methods with high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current approaches by modeling the sequential nature of deformation development, treating time as more than just an input parameter.

Method: Uses a transformer with triple-stream attention (temporal, feature, batch) for autoregressive sequence modeling of creep patterns.

Result: Achieves 1.63% mean absolute percentage error and R2 of 0.999, with Young's modulus as the top predictive feature.

Conclusion: Demonstrates transformers' viability in materials science, offering potential for data-driven structural behavior prediction.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LLMs to evolving safety policies is expensive; SafeSteer offers a practical alternative.

Method: Uses category-specific steering vectors, a gradient-free unsupervised method, and avoids contrastive data.

Result: Effective across LLMs, datasets, and risk categories, maintaining text quality and topic relevance.

Conclusion: SafeSteer provides precise, customizable safety adjustments without blanket refusals.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

### [416] [Localized Forest Fire Risk Prediction: A Department-Aware Approach for Operational Decision Support](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04254)
*Nicolas Caron, Christophe Guyeux, Hassan Noura, Benjamin Aynes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a localized AI approach for forest fire prediction in France, addressing the oversimplification of traditional binary classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change has increased fire risks, necessitating more accurate, region-specific predictions for practical use by firefighters.

Method: The study introduces a departmental-level fire risk assessment model using state-of-the-art AI on a novel dataset for metropolitan France.

Result: A national-scale AI benchmark is presented, providing actionable, region-specific fire risk predictions.

Conclusion: The approach improves fire risk modeling for operational use, with future work directions highlighted.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying neural networks on edge devices is challenging due to high memory and runtime complexity. Existing verification methods struggle with structural changes and focus only on quantization.

Method: MUC-G4 encodes original and compressed networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and uses Minimal Unsat Cores (MUCs) from the original network to guide verification.

Result: MUC-G4 effectively handles quantization and pruning, achieving high proof reuse rates and significant speedup in verification time.

Conclusion: MUC-G4 provides a reliable solution for verifying compressed neural networks, ensuring their safety and practicality in real-world applications.

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of response distribution on DPO's policy updates and optimization landscape.

Method: Analyzes gradient descent dynamics, designs a simplified alignment model, and conducts empirical experiments.

Result: High-quality responses enhance gradient signals and improve policy learning.

Conclusion: The findings support the practical use of online DPO by justifying its effectiveness.

Abstract: We study the role of the sampling distribution in Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and aim to understand its impact on DPO's training dynamics.
Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework
in practice.

### [419] [Conservative classifiers do consistently well with improving agents: characterizing statistical and online learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05252)
*Dravyansh Sharma, Alec Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores learnability in strategic classification, focusing on genuine agent improvements rather than deception. It introduces new concepts and resolves open questions from prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how machine learning performs when agents genuinely improve for better classification, contrasting with deceptive behaviors.

Method: Introduces asymmetric minimally consistent concept classes and studies learnability under Euclidean ball improvement sets and bounded noise models.

Result: Characterizes proper and improper learning, resolves open questions, and achieves lower generalization error in bounded noise models.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of strategic classification with genuine agent improvements, providing new theoretical insights and practical learning methods.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

*Xu Zheng, Chaohao Lin, Sipeng Chen, Zhuomin Chen, Jimeng Shi, Wei Cheng, Jayantha Obeysekera, Jason Liu, Dongsheng Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SF2Bench, a dataset for compound flood analysis in South Florida, and evaluates six machine learning methods for flood forecasting, highlighting their varied performance in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing global flood risks and inefficiency of traditional physics-based methods motivate the need for improved flood forecasting using machine learning, despite data scarcity challenges.

Method: The study integrates tide, rainfall, groundwater, and human management data into SF2Bench and evaluates six ML methods (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, Transformers, and LLMs) for flood forecasting.

Result: Experiments show varying performance across methods, revealing their diverse capabilities in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies in compound floods.

Conclusion: SF2Bench enables detailed analysis of flood drivers, and the study highlights the potential of diverse ML approaches for improving flood forecasting.

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

*Runxiang Wang, Boxiao Wang, Kai Li, Yifan Zhang, Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DrSR enhances symbolic regression by combining data-driven insights and reflective learning, outperforming traditional and LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches lack explicit data understanding and systematic reflection, limiting robustness and discovery capability.

Method: DrSR integrates data analysis (e.g., structural relationships) with reflective learning, creating a feedback loop for equation refinement.

Result: DrSR improves valid equation rates and outperforms classical and recent LLM-based methods in accuracy, generalization, and efficiency.

Conclusion: DrSR demonstrates strong potential for scientific equation discovery by balancing data understanding and generation reflection.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

*Stephen Smith, Cormac Purcell, Zdenka Kuncic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) is proposed for on-board satellite processing to detect natural disasters, prioritizing data for low-latency downlinking. It outperforms state-of-the-art AI with minimal resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bandwidth limitations in satellite data downlinking by enabling efficient on-board processing for timely disaster response.

Method: PANN uses memristor-based dynamic weights and physics-constrained features to detect changes in multi-spectral images without training.

Result: PANN matched or surpassed a state-of-the-art AI model in disaster detection, proving effective for resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: PANN offers a viable, training-free solution for on-board satellite data prioritization, enhancing disaster response efficiency.

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how spurious features in training data lead to imbalanced test performance, identifying memorization in a small subset of neurons as the cause. A novel framework to eliminate these patterns improves minority group performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why machine learning models perform poorly on minority groups due to reliance on spurious features and to explore the role of memorization in this imbalance.

Method: Analyzes memorization in a small set of neurons, provides empirical evidence, and introduces a framework to eliminate spurious memorization patterns during training.

Result: Demonstrates that spurious memorization in a few neurons drives imbalanced performance and shows that removing these patterns improves minority group accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings reveal how neural networks encode spurious knowledge, offering insights for improving robustness to spurious correlations.

Abstract: Machine learning models often rely on simple spurious features -- patterns in
training data that correlate with targets but are not causally related to them,
like image backgrounds in foreground classification. This reliance typically
leads to imbalanced test performance across minority and majority groups. In
this work, we take a closer look at the fundamental cause of such imbalanced
performance through the lens of memorization, which refers to the ability to
predict accurately on atypical examples (minority groups) in the training set
but failing in achieving the same accuracy in the testing set. This paper
systematically shows the ubiquitous existence of spurious features in a small
set of neurons within the network, providing the first-ever evidence that
memorization may contribute to imbalanced group performance. Through three
experimental sources of converging empirical evidence, we find the property of
a small subset of neurons or channels in memorizing minority group information.
Inspired by these findings, we hypothesize that spurious memorization,
concentrated within a small subset of neurons, plays a key role in driving
imbalanced group performance. To further substantiate this hypothesis, we show
that eliminating these unnecessary spurious memorization patterns via a novel
framework during training can significantly affect the model performance on
minority groups. Our experimental results across various architectures and
benchmarks offer new insights on how neural networks encode core and spurious
knowledge, laying the groundwork for future research in demystifying robustness
to spurious correlation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Backbone Augmented Training (BAT) to improve adaptation training by leveraging backbone data, introducing ALBAT for efficient implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited adaptation data hinders performance; leveraging backbone data can address this challenge.

Method: Proposes BAT, formulates key propositions, introduces ALBAT algorithm for data selection.

Result: ALBAT enhances adaptation training in personalization and language generation with scarce data.

Conclusion: BAT and ALBAT effectively improve adaptation training by utilizing backbone data.

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

### [425] [Relational reasoning and inductive bias in transformers trained on a transitive inference task](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04289)
*Jesse Geerts, Stephanie Chan, Claudia Clopath, Kimberly Stachenfeld*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers excel in relational reasoning, with in-weights learning (IWL) naturally generalizing transitive inference, while in-context learning (ICL) requires pre-training on structured tasks to achieve similar results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers perform relational reasoning, specifically transitive inference, and compare their behavior in two learning regimes: IWL and ICL.

Method: Analyze transformers' performance on transitive inference tasks under IWL (storing information in network parameters) and ICL (using input sequence information). Pre-train ICL models on structured tasks like linear regression.

Result: IWL models generalize transitive inference naturally, while ICL models without pre-training fail. Pre-trained ICL models exhibit human-like reasoning patterns without forming induction circuits.

Conclusion: Pre-training on structured tasks enables transformers to develop representations supporting in-context relational reasoning, bridging the gap between IWL and ICL performance.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ensemble-based algorithm for posterior sampling in Bayesian inverse problems using diffusion models, avoiding heuristic approximations and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DM-based posterior sampling methods rely on heuristic approximations, limiting their effectiveness. This work aims to leverage DMs' generative capabilities without such approximations.

Method: The algorithm combines DM-based methods with sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), deriving a modified PDE for posterior evolution and simulating it via stochastic weighted particle methods.

Result: Theoretical bounds show the error depends on the score function's training error and particle count. Empirically, the method outperforms existing DM-based approaches in imaging inverse problems.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm provides more accurate reconstructions by avoiding heuristic approximations and leveraging DMs' generative power.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have proven to be effective in modeling
high-dimensional distributions, leading to their widespread adoption for
representing complex priors in Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). However,
current DM-based posterior sampling methods proposed for solving common BIPs
rely on heuristic approximations to the generative process. To exploit the
generative capability of DMs and avoid the usage of such approximations, we
propose an ensemble-based algorithm that performs posterior sampling without
the use of heuristic approximations. Our algorithm is motivated by existing
works that combine DM-based methods with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
method. By examining how the prior evolves through the diffusion process
encoded by the pre-trained score function, we derive a modified partial
differential equation (PDE) governing the evolution of the corresponding
posterior distribution. This PDE includes a modified diffusion term and a
reweighting term, which can be simulated via stochastic weighted particle
methods. Theoretically, we prove that the error between the true posterior
distribution can be bounded in terms of the training error of the pre-trained
score function and the number of particles in the ensemble. Empirically, we
validate our algorithm on several inverse problems in imaging to show that our
method gives more accurate reconstructions compared to existing DM-based
methods.

*Wenhan Xu, Jiashuo Jiang, Lei Deng, Danny Hin-Kwok Tsang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LDPTRLQ, a novel algorithm combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with reinforcement learning (RL) for IoT optimization, ensuring queue stability and outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing complex optimization challenges in IoT by integrating Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL for better performance and stability.

Method: Derived an effective method combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under common conditions, proposing the LDPTRLQ algorithm.

Result: LDPTRLQ outperforms baseline methods in simulations, showing superior compatibility and stability.

Conclusion: The LDPTRLQ algorithm effectively balances short-term optimization with long-term RL goals, validated by theoretical and experimental results.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

*Fengze Liu, Haoyu Wang, Joonhyuk Cho, Dan Roth, Andrew W. Lo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoCT combines large language models and classical ML for interpretable, scalable clinical trial outcome prediction, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trials are costly and slow; accurate outcome prediction can reduce costs and speed up drug discovery. Existing deep learning models lack interpretability and are prone to label leakage.

Method: AutoCT autonomously generates and refines tabular features using large language models and Monte Carlo Tree Search for optimization.

Result: AutoCT matches or surpasses SOTA methods in clinical trial prediction with limited self-refinement iterations.

Conclusion: AutoCT offers a scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient solution for clinical trial prediction.

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bird-MAE improves bird-sound classification by adapting the training pipeline, achieving state-of-the-art results and introducing efficient prototypical probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose Audio-MAE models struggle with fine-grained bird-sound classification due to subtle inter-species differences and high intra-species variability.

Method: Adapts pretraining, fine-tuning, and frozen feature utilization using BirdSet, and introduces prototypical probing for efficiency.

Result: Bird-MAE sets new benchmarks in multi-label classification and outperforms linear probing by up to 37% in MAP.

Conclusion: Tailored self-supervised pipelines like Bird-MAE are effective for fine-grained audio domains, demonstrating robust few-shot capabilities.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have shown competitive results in audio
classification by learning rich semantic representations through an efficient
self-supervised reconstruction task. However, general-purpose models fail to
generalize well when applied directly to fine-grained audio domains.
Specifically, bird-sound classification requires distinguishing subtle
inter-species differences and managing high intra-species acoustic variability,
thereby revealing the performance limitations of general-domain Audio-MAE
models. This work demonstrates that bridging this domain gap requires more than
domain-specific pretraining data; adapting the entire training pipeline is
crucial. We systematically revisit and adapt the pretraining recipe,
fine-tuning methods, and frozen feature utilization to bird sounds using
BirdSet, a large-scale bioacoustic dataset comparable to AudioSet. Our
resulting Bird-MAE achieves new state-of-the-art results in BirdSet's
multi-label classification benchmark. Additionally, we introduce the
parameter-efficient prototypical probing, enhancing the utility of frozen MAE
representations and closely approaching fine-tuning performance in low-resource
settings. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear probing by up to
37%$_\text{p}$ in MAP and narrow the gap to fine-tuning to approximately
3.3%$_\text{p}$ on average across BirdSet downstream tasks. Bird-MAE also
demonstrates robust few-shot capabilities with prototypical probing in our
newly established few-shot benchmark on BirdSet, highlighting the potential of
tailored self-supervised learning pipelines for fine-grained audio domains.

*Dan Qiao, Wenhao Li, Shanchao Yang, Hongyuan Zha, Baoxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses distributional shifts in offline cooperative MARL by proposing a sequential score function decomposition method and a diffusion-based generative model to align policies with high-reward regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge arises from multi-equilibrium tasks causing multimodal joint behavior policies and heterogeneous data, leading to policy distribution shifts.

Method: A sequential score function decomposition method distills per-agent regularization signals, combined with a diffusion-based generative model to guide policy updates.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in particle environments and Multi-agent MuJoCo benchmarks.

Conclusion: First work to explicitly address the offline-online MARL distributional gap, enabling more generalizable offline MARL methods.

Abstract: Offline cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces unique
challenges due to distributional shifts, particularly stemming from the high
dimensionality of joint action spaces and the presence of out-of-distribution
joint action selections. In this work, we highlight that a fundamental
challenge in offline MARL arises from the multi-equilibrium nature of
cooperative tasks, which induces a highly multimodal joint behavior policy
space coupled with heterogeneous-quality behavior data. This makes it difficult
for individual policy regularization to align with a consistent coordination
pattern, leading to the policy distribution shift problems. To tackle this
challenge, we design a sequential score function decomposition method that
distills per-agent regularization signals from the joint behavior policy, which
induces coordinated modality selection under decentralized execution
constraints. Then we leverage a flexible diffusion-based generative model to
learn these score functions from multimodal offline data, and integrate them
into joint-action critics to guide policy updates toward high-reward,
in-distribution regions under a shared team reward. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple particle environments and
Multi-agent MuJoCo benchmarks consistently. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to explicitly address the distributional gap between offline
and online MARL, paving the way for more generalizable offline policy-based
MARL methods.

Conclusion: Customized forecasting strategies for distinct consumer groups and detailed weather data significantly enhance forecasting accuracy, aiding grid stability in renewable energy transitions.

Abstract: Ensuring grid stability in the transition to renewable energy sources
requires accurate power demand forecasting. This study addresses the need for
precise forecasting by differentiating among industrial, commercial, and
residential consumers through customer clusterisation, tailoring the
forecasting models to capture the unique consumption patterns of each group. A
feature selection process is done for each consumer type including temporal,
socio-economic, and weather-related data obtained from the Copernicus Earth

Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) and Very Short-Term Load Forecasting (VSTLF)
are explored and compared, determining the most effective approaches. With all
that, the main contribution of this work are the new forecasting approaches
proposed, which have demonstrated superior performance compared to simpler
models, both for STLF and VSTLF, highlighting the importance of customized
forecasting strategies for different consumer groups and demonstrating the
impact of incorporating detailed weather data on forecasting accuracy. These
advancements contribute to more reliable power demand predictions, thereby
supporting grid stability.

*N Guerin, M Nakhla, A Dehoux, J L Loyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep-learning framework for short-term hauling-fleet capacity forecasting in open-pit mining, combining real-world data with synthetic breakdown scenarios, outperforms traditional methods with reduced prediction volatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting is vital due to operational uncertainties like weather, breakdowns, and crew availability in open-pit mining.

Method: Proposes a hybrid deep-learning approach using XGBoost and LSTM networks, integrating real operational data and synthetic breakdown scenarios.

Result: XGBoost achieves a MedAE of 14.3%, LSTM 15.1%. SHAP analysis highlights key predictors like rainfall and breakdown frequencies.

Conclusion: The hybrid model improves forecasting robustness, with future enhancements planned for maintenance and human resource data integration.

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

*Abdourrahmane Mahamane Atto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 4-step process enhances ensemble learning via softlog-softmax cascades, focusing on diversity, neural engineering, information theory, and performance evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve consistency and dependability in next-gen ensemble learning systems by leveraging softlog-softmax cascades.

Method: 1. Anatomical: Select canonical forms for ensemble diversity. 2. Physiological: Use softlog for consistent weak logarithmic operations. 3. Neural info theory: Propose softlog-based entropy/divergence. 4. Derive a performance tensor for evaluation.

Result: Diverse ensembles are more effective for complex problems; softlog-softmax layers ensure consistent intermediate decisions.

Conclusion: The 4-step process enhances ensemble learning by integrating diversity, neural engineering, and information theory, leading to reliable evaluation.

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

*Jiin Kim, Byeongjun Shin, Jinha Chung, Minsoo Rhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the system-level costs and sustainability concerns of LLM-based AI agents, revealing diminishing returns and high computational demands despite improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing concerns about the efficiency, cost, and sustainability of dynamic, multi-turn AI agents compared to static models.

Method: Comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying resource usage, latency, energy consumption, and power demands across designs and scaling strategies.

Result: Agents improve accuracy with more compute but face diminishing returns, high latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs.

Conclusion: A paradigm shift toward compute-efficient agent design is needed to balance performance and real-world deployability.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RedRFT is a lightweight benchmark to standardize RFT-based red teaming for LLMs, addressing implementation inconsistencies and enabling rapid prototyping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified benchmark for Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT)-based red teaming methods, especially in PPO-based implementations, affects stability and reproducibility.

Method: Introduces RedRFT, combining CleanRL and Tianshou strengths, offering modular PPO components and diverse metrics for plug-and-play experimentation.

Result: Extensive ablation studies clarify the impact of key components (LoRA, KL divergence, Lagrange Multiplier) on RFT performance.

Conclusion: RedRFT aids in understanding RFT nuances and accelerates innovation in red teaming for LLMs.

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

### [436] [You Only Train Once](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04349)
*Christos Sakaridis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: YOTO (You Only Train Once) automates loss weight hyperparameter optimization in one training run, outperforming grid search in tasks like 3D estimation and semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods require multiple training runs for loss selection and weighting, which is inefficient. YOTO aims to streamline this by optimizing loss weights in one shot.

Method: YOTO treats loss hyperparameters as regular network parameters, optimizing them via gradient-based methods. It uses a differentiable composite loss layer with a softmax operation and introduces a regularization loss for uniformity and boundedness.

Result: YOTO consistently outperforms grid-search models on unseen test data in 3D estimation and semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: YOTO offers an efficient, one-shot solution for loss hyperparameter optimization, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

### [437] [Half-Layered Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04352)
*Ethem Alpaydin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A "half" layer of hidden units with partially randomized and partially trained weights is proposed, reducing parameters while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the number of modifiable weights in hidden units without sacrificing performance, leveraging randomization for regularization.

Method: Half units use fixed random weights for input summation, followed by two modifiable weights for scaling and translation before nonlinearity.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST show reasonable accuracy with fewer parameters due to randomized connections.

Conclusion: Half layers offer a promising approach for efficient deep networks by balancing randomization and training.

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

Result: The framework enables robust multi-objective reward functions in trading, with theoretical properties like monotonicity and modularity analyzed.

Conclusion: This approach offers a general blueprint for multi-objective reward functions in trading, extendable with additional risk measures or adaptive weighting.

Abstract: We propose a novel composite reward function for reinforcement learning in

TL;DR: The paper reexpresses the hyperDT algorithm in the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces, simplifying it into pre- and post-processing steps around Euclidean tree-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve flexibility, speed, and accuracy of hyperbolic decision trees by leveraging existing Euclidean optimizations and simplifying the codebase.

Method: Reformulate hyperDT in the Beltrami-Klein model, enabling thresholding operations like Euclidean trees and wrapping around existing Euclidean models.

Result: Enhanced performance (speed, accuracy) and maintainability, with a simpler, extensible implementation.

Conclusion: The wrapper approach successfully bridges hyperbolic and Euclidean tree models, unlocking optimizations and simplifying development.

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper theoretically analyzes sample replay in continual learning, revealing non-monotonic forgetting and cases where replay can harm performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical underpinnings of sample replay in mitigating forgetting in continual learning, especially in over-parameterized linear regression.

Method: Theoretical analysis of sample replay in a continual linear regression setting, examining the role of replayed samples and task subspace relationships.

Result: Forgetting can be non-monotonic with replay samples; replay may harm performance in worst-case or distributional settings. Empirical evidence extends findings to neural networks.

Conclusion: Sample replay's effectiveness depends on sample choice and task relationships, highlighting potential pitfalls even in benign scenarios.

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

*Théo Vincent, Yogesh Tripathi, Tim Faust, Yaniv Oren, Jan Peters, Carlo D'Eramo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes iS-QL, a method using a copy of the last linear layer as a target network to balance stability and efficiency in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eliminating target networks in RL causes instability, but keeping them limits flexibility. iS-QL offers a middle ground.

Method: Uses a shared last linear layer as a target network, enabling iterated Q-learning for improved performance.

Result: iS-QL enhances sample efficiency, reduces memory usage, and maintains training time comparable to target-based methods.

Conclusion: iS-QL bridges target-free and target-based RL, offering scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

*Suzan Ece Ada, Emre Ugur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UMCNP combines policy gradient and task inference for few-shot meta-RL, improving sample efficiency without extra meta-training samples by leveraging CNPs and reusing PPG data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of missing reward signals during meta-testing while maintaining sample efficiency.

Method: Hybrid approach using CNPs for task inference and reusing PPG meta-RL data offline. Infers latent dynamics from a single test rollout.

Result: Outperforms baselines in 2D-Point Agent and continuous control tasks with fewer meta-testing samples.

Conclusion: UMCNP effectively adapts to unseen tasks with minimal samples, demonstrating scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

*Achleshwar Luthra, Tianbao Yang, Tomer Galanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper bridges the gap between self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) and its supervised variant (NSCL), proving their equivalence as class count grows. It analyzes NSCL's geometric structure and introduces a bound for few-shot error, validated empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish theoretical foundations for self-supervised contrastive learning, which lacks full understanding despite empirical success.

Method: Theoretical analysis of CL and NSCL losses, geometric characterization of NSCL minimizers, and introduction of a few-shot error bound.

Result: CL and NSCL losses converge as class count increases; NSCL exhibits specific geometric properties; the few-shot error bound is tight.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical insights into CL, showing its equivalence to NSCL and practical implications for few-shot learning.

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

*Egor Petrov, Grigoriy Evseev, Aleksey Antonov, Andrey Veprikov, Pavel Plyusnin, Nikolay Bushkov, Stanislav Moiseev, Aleksandr Beznosikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes zero-order optimization methods, JAGUAR SignSGD and JAGUAR Muon, for efficient fine-tuning of large language models, reducing memory and computational costs while maintaining convergence quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional first-order optimizers like SGD and Adam are inefficient for large models, prompting the need for memory- and compute-efficient alternatives.

Method: The authors introduce zero-order momentum-based algorithms (JAGUAR SignSGD and JAGUAR Muon) that leverage parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA, requiring fewer function evaluations and parameters.

Result: The proposed methods achieve or surpass the convergence quality of first-order methods while significantly reducing memory usage, validated through LLM fine-tuning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Zero-order optimization methods are a practical and theoretically grounded solution for resource-constrained LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KOALA++ is a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm for neural networks, improving upon KOALA by modeling structured gradient uncertainty efficiently without expensive second-order calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of second-order methods in neural network training while capturing richer gradient uncertainty structure.

Method: Estimates parameter covariance matrix recursively using compact gradient covariance products, avoiding full matrix storage or inversions.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable or superior to state-of-the-art optimizers in tasks like image classification and language modeling, with first-order efficiency.

Conclusion: KOALA++ offers a balanced approach, combining accuracy and efficiency by modeling gradient uncertainty effectively.

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

### [446] [Grokking and Generalization Collapse: Insights from \texttt{HTSR} theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04434)
*Hari K. Prakash, Charles H. Martin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a novel 'anti-grokking' phase in neural networks, distinct from pre-grokking and grokking, where test accuracy collapses while training accuracy remains high. The Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) metric α effectively detects all three phases, unlike other metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and characterize the grokking phenomena in neural networks, particularly identifying new phases like anti-grokking, and to validate the effectiveness of the HTSR metric α in detecting these phases.

Method: A 3-layer MLP is trained on a 1k-sample subset of MNIST with and without weight decay. The HTSR metric α, along with other metrics, is used to analyze the training phases, including anti-grokking, pre-grokking, and grokking.

Result: The study reveals anti-grokking as a distinct late-stage phase, detectable only by the HTSR α metric. Other metrics fail to distinguish grokking from anti-grokking. Correlation Traps and spectral densities confirm overfitting.

Conclusion: The HTSR α metric is a universal tool for measuring layer convergence and generalization, with α ≈ 2 as the target. It uniquely identifies anti-grokking, providing insights into overfitting without test data access.

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

*Robin Yadav, Qi Yan, Guy Wolf, Avishek Joey Bose, Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) is a discrete flow-matching framework for single-step retrosynthesis, outperforming SOTA with 60.0% top-1 accuracy and improved diversity via Feynman-Kac steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate and diverse single-step retrosynthesis prediction in organic chemistry.

Method: Uses a Markov bridge between target and reactant molecules, reaction center identification for synthons, and Feynman-Kac steering with Sequential Monte Carlo resampling.

Result: Achieves 60.0% top-1 accuracy, 20% better than SOTA, and improves top-5 round-trip accuracy by 19%.

Conclusion: RSF enhances retrosynthesis planning with higher accuracy and diversity, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

### [448] [Selective Matching Losses -- Not All Scores Are Created Equal](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04446)
*Gil I. Shamir, Manfred K. Warmuth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces selective matching loss functions to prioritize accurate predictions in specific regions of a domain, using link functions to emphasize high-sensitivity areas. It extends these losses to multi-class settings and demonstrates their advantages in various applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate predictions are often critical in specific regions of a domain, while less important in others. Traditional losses lack the ability to prioritize these regions, leading to underspecification.

Method: The paper designs selective matching loss functions using increasing link functions (e.g., Sigmoid, hyperbolic sine) to emphasize high-sensitivity regions. It extends these to multi-class settings using composite Softmax functions.

Result: Selective losses outperform traditional losses in applications like dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking, and LLM fine-tuning, by better distinguishing between high and low importance regions.

Conclusion: Selective loss functions provide a flexible framework to improve prediction accuracy in critical regions, addressing limitations of traditional losses and enhancing performance in diverse applications.

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI framework, enhances NIDS with deep clustering, symbolic reasoning, and uncertainty quantification, outperforming traditional models. A transfer learning strategy for ODXU is also introduced, showing effectiveness with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robustness, interpretability, and generalization in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by integrating Neurosymbolic AI and uncertainty quantification. Also, to explore transfer learning's potential in cybersecurity.

Method: Extended ODXU framework with deep embedded clustering, symbolic reasoning (XGBoost), and uncertainty quantification (score-based and metamodel-based methods). Transfer learning strategy involves reusing pre-trained components and fine-tuning.

Result: ODXU outperforms traditional neural models on CIC-IDS-2017 dataset. Transfer learning with ODXU works well on ACI-IoT-2023, even with limited data. Metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches.

Conclusion: ODXU enhances NIDS performance and interpretability. Transfer learning is viable in cybersecurity, and metamodel-based UQ methods are superior.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the distinction between systematicity of behavior and representations in ML models, analyzing benchmarks and suggesting ways to assess representational systematicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between theoretical arguments for systematicity (Fodor and Pylyshyn) and the focus on behavioral systematicity in benchmarks and models.

Method: Analyzes key benchmarks in language and vision using Hadley's taxonomy of systematic generalization and highlights methods from mechanistic interpretability.

Result: Identifies limitations in current benchmarks and proposes ways to evaluate representational systematicity.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the need to shift focus from behavioral to representational systematicity for better generalization in ML models.

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models classify dental providers into standard and safety net clinic categories, with Neural Networks achieving the highest accuracy (94.1%). Feature selection and treatment-related metrics are key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classification of dental providers for better resource allocation, especially for underserved populations, using ML models despite high missing data.

Method: Used 12 ML models (e.g., Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting) on a dataset with 20 features, employing feature ranking (information gain, Gini index, ANOVA) and 10-fold cross-validation.

Result: Neural Network performed best (94.1% accuracy), with treatment-related features being most predictive. Models improved with more features, and ensemble methods handled missing data well.

Conclusion: Feature selection enhances ML model efficiency in imbalanced healthcare datasets, advocating for combining feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML for better classification.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Motivation: Effective classification of dental providers (e.g., standard vs. safety net clinic providers) is vital for optimizing healthcare resource allocation and policy planning, particularly for underserved groups.

Method: Analyzed a 2018 dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features, tested multiple ML algorithms (kNN, Decision Trees, SVM, SGD, Random Forest, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting) using 10-fold cross-validation. Evaluated performance via AUC, CA, F1-score, precision, and recall.

Conclusion: Advanced ML techniques, especially ensemble and deep learning models, enhance dental provider classification, aiding better resource distribution and service delivery to underserved populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service
(FFS), Geographic Managed Care, and Pre-Paid Health Plans. Providers were
categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine

significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource
distribution, benefiting underserved populations.

TL;DR: COSMOS is a framework for predicting LLM adaptation outcomes, reducing computational costs by up to 98.71% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal selection of LLM adaptation strategies under resource constraints is challenging and costly.

Method: Introduces COSMOS, using lightweight proxy models and low-sample scaling laws to predict performance and cost.

Result: Achieves high accuracy, reducing costs by 92.72% on average and up to 98.71% in intensive scenarios.

Conclusion: Efficient prediction of LLM adaptation outcomes is feasible and significantly reduces computational overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Orthogonalizing gradients ($\perp$Grad) during training improves model calibration without losing accuracy, outperforming SGD in metrics like test loss and predictive entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance model calibration while maintaining accuracy, addressing issues like overconfidence and robustness under input corruption.

Method: Orthogonalizing gradients during training, which is optimizer-agnostic and works with post-hoc calibration techniques.

Result: Improved calibration metrics (lower test loss, reduced overconfidence, higher entropy) and graceful degradation under corruption.

Conclusion: $\perp$Grad offers a practical, efficient way to improve calibration, with theoretical guarantees of convergence and stationary points in homogeneous networks.

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CryoBoltz combines cryo-EM density maps with protein structure prediction models to capture conformational diversity in dynamic biomolecular systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing protein structure prediction models struggle with conformational diversity, while cryo-EM faces challenges in deriving atomic models from raw data. Bridging these gaps is the goal.

Method: CryoBoltz uses cryo-EM density maps to guide the sampling trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model, incorporating global and local structural constraints.

Result: The method successfully builds atomic models for diverse dynamic systems like transporters and antibodies, leveraging experimental data.

Conclusion: CryoBoltz effectively bridges protein structure prediction and cryo-EM, enabling accurate modeling of conformational diversity.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of

*Cliff B. Abbott, Mark Elo, Dmytro A. Bozhko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PGT is a new training method for physical reservoir computing that approximates gradients via perturbations, enabling training without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitation of physical reservoir computing where backpropagation is infeasible due to the black-box nature of physical reservoirs.

Method: Uses random perturbations in parameter space to approximate gradients, relying only on forward passes. Tested on simulated networks and experimental hardware.

Result: PGT achieves performance comparable to backpropagation in cases where backpropagation is impractical.

Conclusion: PGT enables deeper integration of physical reservoirs into neural networks, promising energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multiscale implicit neural emulator improves long-term prediction accuracy in neural PDE solvers by leveraging hierarchical future state representations and adjusting temporal downsampling ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural PDE solvers face challenges with error accumulation, stability, and physical consistency over long time horizons.

Method: The approach conditions on lower-dimensional future state hierarchies and uses predictions ahead in time at varying compression rates for refinements.

Result: The method achieves high short-term accuracy and stable long-term forecasts, outperforming autoregressive baselines with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed emulator enhances long-term prediction accuracy and stability in modeling complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical
systems, but often struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and
maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding
minimal computational overhead.

*Geon-Woo Kim, Junbo Li, Shashidhar Gandham, Omar Baldonado, Adithya Gangidi, Pavan Balaji, Zhangyang Wang, Aditya Akella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HALoS is a hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework for training large language models (LLMs) in geo-distributed environments, reducing communication costs and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLMs across geographically distributed accelerators faces high communication costs and uneven hardware utilization, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: HALoS introduces local parameter servers (LPSs) within regions and a global parameter server (GPS) to merge updates, minimizing inter-region communication and leveraging fast intra-region links.

Result: HALoS achieves up to 7.5x faster convergence than synchronous baselines and 2.1x improvement over existing asynchronous methods, while maintaining model quality.

Conclusion: Hierarchical, server-side update accumulation and global model merging are effective for scalable and efficient LLM training in heterogeneous, geo-distributed settings.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

*Luca Ghafourpour, Valentin Duruisseaux, Bahareh Tolooshams, Philip H. Wong, Costas A. Anastassiou, Anima Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOBLE is a neural operator framework that predicts neural dynamics from interpretable features, addressing variability and computational constraints in bio-realistic neuron modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neuron modeling approaches are limited by data variability and computational costs, while deep learning lacks biophysical complexity.

Method: NOBLE learns a mapping from neuron features to voltage responses, trained on biophysically realistic models to predict dynamic distributions.

Result: NOBLE achieves a 4200x speedup over numerical solvers and generates synthetic neurons with experimental variability.

Conclusion: NOBLE advances neuron modeling, enabling scalable, efficient, and biophysically accurate simulations for neuroscience and AI applications.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

*Yuanpei Gao, Qi Yan, Yan Leng, Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural MJD combines neural networks with a non-stationary Merton jump diffusion model to improve time series prediction by explicitly modeling stochastic processes and abrupt changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models struggle with non-stationary data and abrupt changes due to their black-box nature and lack of explicit stochastic modeling.

Method: Neural MJD uses a stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework with a time-inhomogeneous Itô diffusion and compound Poisson process. It includes a likelihood truncation mechanism and a novel solver (Euler-Maruyama with restart).

Result: Neural MJD outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The model effectively addresses non-stationary data challenges by integrating explicit stochastic modeling with neural networks, offering improved generalization and performance.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model-driven quantum federated learning (mdQFL) algorithm to address challenges in federated learning, such as training bottlenecks, large-scale device involvement, and non-IID data. It reduces communication costs by 50% while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of training bottlenecks, large-scale device participation, and non-IID data distributions in federated learning (FL) and quantum federated learning (QFL) motivated the development of an efficient and adaptable solution.

Method: The authors propose a model-driven quantum federated learning (mdQFL) algorithm, which includes training and update personalization and test generalization. The method is evaluated under diverse non-IID conditions using Qiskit.

Result: Experiments show a 50% reduction in communication costs while maintaining or exceeding accuracy. Local model training also improves compared to standard QFL.

Conclusion: The mdQFL algorithm effectively addresses FL challenges, offering efficiency and adaptability. It is the first to explore personalization and generalization in QFL, with potential applications in other FL scenarios.

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

TL;DR: A structured workflow for unsupervised learning in science is proposed to ensure reliable, reproducible discoveries, illustrated with an astronomy case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardization in unsupervised learning workflows hinders reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.

Method: Proposes a workflow including question formulation, data preparation, modeling, validation, and documentation.

Result: Demonstrates the workflow's effectiveness in refining globular clusters of Milky Way stars.

Conclusion: A carefully-designed unsupervised learning workflow enhances scientific discovery through validation and reproducibility.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised
learning workflows for making reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.
In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

*Kareem Amin, Salman Avestimehr, Sara Babakniya, Alex Bie, Weiwei Kong, Natalia Ponomareva, Umar Syed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves DP language model inference by clustering input data and using median aggregation for next-token predictions, achieving better text quality and lower privacy costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sampling in DP language model inference degrades text quality, especially for heterogeneous topics, prompting the need for a better method.

Method: Clusters input data before batch selection and aggregates next-token predictions using medians instead of averages for improved similarity and privacy.

Result: Demonstrates better representativeness (e.g., MAUVE) and downstream task performance at lower privacy costs than prior methods.

Conclusion: Clustering and median aggregation enhance DP language model inference, offering higher-quality synthetic data with improved privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accommodate multiple large models within constrained memory budgets efficiently, avoiding the need for ground truth labels or test samples.

Method: Leverages SVD singular values for task importance, uses StatsMergeLearner for weight distribution modeling, and employs Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging heterogeneous architectures.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality variations.

Conclusion: StatsMerging is an effective, label-free solution for model merging, offering superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scaling laws are used to compare models (CLIP and MaMMUT) and datasets, showing MaMMUT's better scalability and efficiency. Results are validated across tasks and datasets, with open-sourced models and code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable systematic comparison of models and datasets for pre-training using scaling laws, avoiding misleading conclusions from single-scale measurements.

Method: Derive full scaling laws for CLIP and MaMMUT using dense measurements across model and sample scales, validated on downstream tasks and datasets.

Result: MaMMUT shows stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than CLIP, achieving 80.3% zero-shot ImageNet-1k accuracy.

Conclusion: Scaling laws provide a robust method for model and dataset comparison, facilitating systematic improvement of foundation models.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

Motivation: To address the issue of information loss and misleading explanations in GNNs caused by discarding directional information during graph symmetrization.

Method: Theoretical and empirical studies analyzing the impact of preserving directional semantics in GNNs.

Result: Preserving directional information significantly enhances explanation quality and fidelity.

Conclusion: Direction-aware GNN explainability is crucial, especially in security-critical applications, to ensure reliable insights for human decision-makers.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where
reliable explanations are vital for supporting human decision-making. However,
the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our
analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity.
Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional

*Cong Geng, Jia Wang, Li Chen, Zhiyong Gao, Jes Frellsen, Søren Hauberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes bidirectional bounds for training energy-based models (EBMs), addressing instability issues by maximizing lower bounds and minimizing upper bounds, leading to improved density estimation and sample generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBMs are challenging to train due to instability issues when using variational lower bounds. The paper aims to stabilize training by introducing bidirectional bounds.

Method: The authors derive four bounds on log-likelihood from different perspectives: singular values of the generator Jacobian, mutual information, gradient penalty-like bounds, and diffusion processes. Algorithms for evaluating these bounds are provided.

Result: Bidirectional bounds stabilize EBM training, resulting in high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Conclusion: Using bidirectional bounds is an effective approach to stabilize EBM training and improve performance in density estimation and generation tasks.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

*Guruprerana Shabadi, Rajeev Alur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes agentic workflows as directed acyclic graphs (agent graphs) and introduces an algorithm to optimize agent compositions for task success and risk minimization, focusing on worst-case risk (value-at-risk).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern agentic systems need to balance task success with risk (safety, fairness, privacy), requiring analysis of low-probability behaviors and optimal agent compositions.

Method: The work defines worst-case risk as tail quantile (value-at-risk) of loss distributions and proposes an efficient algorithm using union bound and dynamic programming to approximate it.

Result: The algorithm is proven near-optimal asymptotically for practical loss functions and validated on control benchmarks with reinforcement learning agents.

Conclusion: The framework effectively approximates value-at-risk and identifies optimal agent compositions, addressing real-world deployment challenges.

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Result: Computes Pareto frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

Conclusion: The model provides a framework for optimizing LLM deployment by balancing cost and speed, offering practical insights for scalable inference.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical model that addresses the economic trade-off between
cost per token versus serial token generation speed when deploying LLMs for
inference at scale. Our model takes into account arithmetic, memory bandwidth,
network bandwidth and latency constraints; and optimizes over different
parallelism setups and batch sizes to find the ones that optimize serial
inference speed at a given cost per token. We use the model to compute Pareto
frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces neural network reprogrammability as a unifying framework for model adaptation techniques like model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt instruction, focusing on manipulating interfaces while keeping parameters frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks is critical, but existing approaches lack a unified understanding.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy categorizing adaptation approaches by manipulation format, location, operator, and output alignment, applicable across data modalities.

Result: The framework connects fragmented research areas, revealing theoretical links and practical distinctions among techniques like in-context learning.

Conclusion: Neural network reprogrammability is a fundamental paradigm for efficient adaptation, with identified challenges and promising research directions.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

*MoonJeong Park, Sunghyun Choi, Jaeseung Heo, Eunhyeok Park, Dongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the overstated impact of oversmoothing in deep GNNs, attributing performance issues to vanishing gradients instead. It advocates for deeper GNN exploration, supported by classical techniques like skip connections and normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To correct misconceptions about oversmoothing in GNNs and highlight the potential of deep architectures by addressing the real issue of vanishing gradients.

Method: Analyzes GNN core operations (aggregation, linear transformation, activation) to distinguish oversmoothing from vanishing gradients, and tests deep GNNs with skip connections and normalization.

Result: Demonstrates that deep GNNs can perform well without oversmoothing issues, attributing prior limitations to vanishing gradients.

Conclusion: Oversmoothing is less critical than believed; deep GNNs are viable with proper techniques, opening new research directions.

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

### [472] [Noise-Resistant Label Reconstruction Feature Selection for Partial Multi-Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04669)
*Wanfu Gao, Hanlin Pan, Qingqi Han, Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel PML feature selection method addresses the curse of dimensionality by leveraging label noise-resistance and connectivity, outperforming existing low-rank assumption-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PML methods struggle with high-dimensional data and poor positive label identification, prompting a need for a more robust approach.

Method: The proposed method uses label noise-resistance for disambiguation, a reformed low-rank assumption for learning, and label connectivity for feature selection.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show the method's superiority in handling high-dimensional data and identifying positive labels.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates dimensionality issues in PML, enhancing classification performance and label identification.

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

TL;DR: Urania is a framework for analyzing LLM chatbot interactions with differential privacy guarantees, using private clustering and keyword extraction methods. It balances data utility and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous privacy protection while extracting meaningful insights from LLM chatbot interactions.

Method: Uses private clustering, keyword extraction (frequency-based, TF-IDF, LLM-guided), and DP tools like clustering and histogram summarization.

Result: Effectively preserves lexical/semantic content and similarity, outperforming non-private methods, while ensuring privacy.

Conclusion: Urania successfully balances privacy and utility in analyzing chatbot interactions.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedAPM, an FL framework using ADMM, mitigates client drift in non-i.i.d. settings by combining first- and second-order proximal terms, achieving faster, more accurate convergence than SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing client drift in FL due to non-i.i.d. data and multimodal datasets by personalizing parts of the model while maintaining shared components.

Method: Proposes FedAPM, using ADMM with augmented Lagrangian function incorporating first- and second-order proximal terms for stability and efficiency.

Result: FedAPM shows superior performance, with 12.3% higher test accuracy, 16.4% better F1 score, and 18.0% improved AUC, requiring fewer communication rounds.

Conclusion: FedAPM effectively mitigates client drift, ensuring stable and efficient convergence in FL, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DIPNet introduces distributional input projections to smooth the loss landscape, improving generalization in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overparameterized models lack insights from training loss alone, and enforcing smoothness for better generalization is challenging.

Method: DIPNet projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer, inducing a smoother loss landscape.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results show improved generalization across architectures and tasks, including adversarial and out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: DIPNet is a versatile and effective method for enhancing generalization in modern deep learning.

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

*Marco Zanotti*

TL;DR: Ensembles improve forecasting accuracy but increase computational costs. Reducing retraining frequency lowers costs with minimal accuracy loss. Small ensembles (2-3 models) often suffice for near-optimal results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational cost in ensemble learning for time series forecasting.

Method: Evaluated ten base models and eight ensemble configurations on M5 and VN1 datasets, considering point and probabilistic accuracy under varying retraining frequencies.

Result: Ensembles boost performance, especially in probabilistic settings, but at high computational cost. Efficiency-driven ensembles balance accuracy and cost. Small ensembles achieve near-optimal results.

Conclusion: Careful ensemble design and retraining strategies enable accurate, robust, and cost-effective forecasts, supporting sustainable AI in forecasting.

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

TL;DR: Proposes a proximal Bregman response function for GNNs to predict edge influence, relaxing convexity assumptions and accounting for message propagation, applicable to deletions and insertions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve GNN interpretability and robustness by accurately predicting edge influence without retraining, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Develops a proximal Bregman response function tailored for GNNs, relaxing convexity and capturing message propagation effects for edge deletions and insertions.

Result: Accurate influence predictions on real-world datasets, with applications in graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The method enhances GNN interpretability and robustness by efficiently predicting edge influence, supporting diverse applications.

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: RLVR optimizes reasoning pattern selection, favoring high-success-rate patterns while maintaining stability. Theoretical analysis shows rapid convergence for strong models and slower dynamics for weaker ones, mitigated by SFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how RL improves reasoning abilities in models, given its empirical success but unclear mechanisms.

Method: Systematic study of RLVR, theoretical analysis of convergence and training dynamics, and validation through experiments.

Result: RLVR preferentially adopts high-success-rate reasoning patterns, with distinct convergence regimes for strong vs. weak models. SFT mitigates slower optimization in weaker models.

Conclusion: RLVR enhances reasoning by optimizing pattern selection, with theoretical insights for improving model training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: Dual-ISL is a novel likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models, offering convexity and continuity advantages over classical divergences, with practical benefits like faster convergence and smoother training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of classical divergences (e.g., KL or Wasserstein) by introducing a convex and continuous rank-based discrepancy for training implicit generative models.

Method: Introduces dual-ISL, interchanging roles of target and model distributions in ISL, and analyzes its properties (convexity, continuity). Extends to multivariate settings via random projections.

Result: Dual-ISL provides faster convergence, smoother training, and better mode collapse prevention compared to classical ISL and other methods, with explicit density approximation.

Conclusion: Dual-ISL is a robust and effective tool for training implicit generative models, combining theoretical advantages with practical performance improvements.

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

*Tonmoy Paul, Mrittika Devi Mati, Md. Mahmudul Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning framework using satellite data is proposed to classify drought severity in Bangladesh, addressing gaps in traditional indices and regional data integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional drought indices overlook key factors like soil moisture and temperature, and machine learning models for drought prediction in Bangladesh lack comprehensive satellite data integration.

Method: The framework uses unsupervised algorithms (K-means, Bayesian Gaussian Mixture) for clustering and classification models (KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes) with weather data (2012-2024).

Result: The approach successfully classifies drought severity but reveals regional variabilities in vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Machine learning models effectively identify and predict drought conditions, highlighting regional differences in Bangladesh.

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes fast unlearning algorithms for generative models to selectively remove unwanted data influence without full retraining, ensuring efficiency and model fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for selective data removal in generative models due to privacy, legal, or harmful content concerns, avoiding costly retraining.

Method: Uses loss gradient orthogonalization to unlearn specific data points efficiently while preserving model quality and desired data influence.

Result: Demonstrates significantly faster unlearning times compared to predecessors like gradient surgery, tested on MNIST and CelebA datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms effectively achieve selective forgetting while maintaining model performance, offering a practical solution for unlearning in generative models.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

*Fei Ding, Baiqiao Wang, Zijian Zeng, Youwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGRPO improves GRPO by adding a self-correction layer to fix errors in initial responses, enhancing reasoning and training stability without dense supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO lacks intermediate supervision, leading to inefficient exploration and reward vanishing in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: MGRPO uses a two-layer approach: standard GRPO generates an initial response, and a second layer corrects errors, creating a self-correction loop.

Result: MGRPO outperforms GRPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks by improving reasoning and self-correction.

Conclusion: MGRPO addresses GRPO's limitations and enhances performance through implicit process-level supervision.

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

TL;DR: Log-linear attention balances efficiency and expressiveness by replacing fixed-size hidden states with logarithmically growing ones, enabling log-linear compute cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottlenecks of quadratic-compute and linear-memory in Transformers while overcoming the limitations of fixed-size hidden states in linear attention and state-space models.

Method: Develop log-linear attention, which uses a logarithmically growing set of hidden states and admits matmul-rich parallelization.

Result: Log-linear variants of Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet perform well compared to their linear-time counterparts.

Conclusion: Log-linear attention offers a scalable and expressive alternative to existing attention mechanisms.

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenGT, a benchmark for Graph Transformers (GTs), addressing the lack of standardized evaluation and understanding of GT design choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GTs show promise but lack exploration of their effective scenarios and design choices. The community needs a standardized benchmark to advance GT research.

Method: OpenGT provides a comprehensive benchmark with standardized settings, evaluating GTs across diverse tasks and datasets.

Result: Key insights include challenges in model transfer, limitations of local attention, efficiency trade-offs, and positional encoding impacts.

Conclusion: OpenGT aims to foster fair, reproducible, and generalizable GT research, supported by an accessible library.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

### [486] [Sparse Autoencoders, Again?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04859)
*Yin Lu, Tong He, Xuening Zhu, David Wipf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), proposing a hybrid model that outperforms both in sparsity and reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the broad applicability of SAEs and VAEs, their limitations in handling structured data and sparse representations remain underaddressed. The paper aims to overcome these weaknesses.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid model combining strengths of SAEs and VAEs, supported by theoretical proofs and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: The hybrid model outperforms SAEs, VAEs, and diffusion models in tasks like estimating manifold dimensions and producing sparser latent representations without sacrificing reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid model effectively addresses limitations of traditional SAEs and VAEs, offering superior performance in sparse representation learning.

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

TL;DR: The paper explores the connection between $k$-medoids and KDE-based VQ through QUBO, showing KDE-QUBO is a special case of $k$-medoids-QUBO under certain kernel assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the relationship between distance-based $k$-medoids and probability-based KDE in VQ, using QUBO as a unifying framework.

Method: Compare heuristic QUBO for $k$-medoids with principled QUBO from KDE-based VQ, analyzing their structural connection.

Result: KDE-QUBO is a special case of $k$-medoids-QUBO under mild kernel assumptions, revealing a deeper relationship.

Conclusion: The study provides new insights into the geometric interpretation of QUBO parameters in VQ, linking two seemingly unrelated paradigms.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

TL;DR: Adam optimizer's adaptive preconditioners can trigger loss spikes due to a critical regime where squared gradients lag behind second-order moment estimates, causing instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanism of loss spikes during training with Adam optimizer, challenging previous explanations tied to loss landscape characteristics.

Method: Analyzed the relationship between squared gradients and second-order moment estimates, identifying a critical regime leading to instability. Verified through experiments on various neural network architectures.

Result: Found that Adam's adaptive preconditioners can push the maximum eigenvalue of the preconditioned Hessian beyond stability thresholds, causing loss spikes.

Conclusion: Adam's preconditioners themselves can induce instability and loss spikes, providing a new explanation beyond loss landscape sharpness.

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 'play to learn' framework using reinforcement learning on logic puzzles to improve LLMs' structured reasoning, showing significant gains in out-of-distribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow heuristics instead of general-purpose reasoning, limiting LLMs' adaptability in unfamiliar settings.

Method: Fine-tuning LLMs via reinforcement learning on seven custom logic puzzles, with binary feedback for correctness to encourage iterative problem-solving.

Result: Improved out-of-distribution performance on mathematical benchmarks, especially for mid-difficulty problems requiring multi-step reasoning.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning over logic puzzles enhances LLMs' transferable reasoning skills, enabling robust generalization without task-specific tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CREAM is a new CBM family that encodes concept-concept and concept-task relationships for better reasoning, using a regularized side-channel for performance without losing concept importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve model reasoning by explicitly encoding relationships between concepts and tasks, while maintaining high concept importance and competitive task performance.

Method: CREAM embeds expert-specified (bi)directed concept-concept and concept-task relationships, severs undesired information flows, and uses a regularized side-channel to ground predictions in relevant concepts.

Result: CREAM achieves task performance comparable to black-box models while relying mainly on concepts, and its embedded relationships ease interventions and reduce concept leakage.

Conclusion: CREAM effectively balances concept importance and task performance, with its explicit relationships enhancing model interpretability and robustness.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

TL;DR: EHR2Path is a novel model for patient pathway prediction, transforming EHR data into structured representations and embedding long-term context for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare systems struggle with managing diverse patient data for personalized care, often missing holistic insights due to narrow approaches.

Method: EHR2Path transforms EHR data into structured representations and uses a summary mechanism for long-term temporal context, optimizing pathway prediction.

Result: EHR2Path outperforms baselines in next-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, enabling detailed patient trajectory forecasts.

Conclusion: The model advances predictive healthcare by efficiently simulating diverse patient trajectories, supporting personalized care.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

*Antonio Almudévar, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, Sameer Khurana, Ricard Marxer, Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Contrastive losses in multimodal learning often fail to align representation spaces due to modality-specific information. The paper proposes a regularization term to improve alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive losses don't effectively remove modality-specific information, hindering aligned representation learning.

Method: Theoretical analysis via Information Bottleneck Principle, empirical hyperparameter study, and a proposed variational regularization term.

Result: The regularization term improves alignment in controlled experiments and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances representation alignment by addressing modality-specific information.

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs) to improve interpretability by using an Information Bottleneck objective, ensuring each representation component retains only relevant concept information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning representations lack interpretability, and existing Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) fail to guarantee that components encode only their assigned concepts, raising concerns about interpretability and intervention validity.

Method: Proposes MCBMs, which incorporate an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective via variational regularization to constrain representation components to relevant concept information.

Result: MCBMs enable concept-level interventions with theoretical guarantees, align with Bayesian principles, and offer design flexibility.

Conclusion: MCBMs address limitations of CBMs by enforcing a true bottleneck, enhancing interpretability and intervention reliability.

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies adversarial training (AT) through class-wise feature attribution, identifying cross-class features as key for robustness and analyzing their role in AT dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms and dynamics of adversarial training, particularly the role of cross-class features in robust classification.

Method: Analyzes AT using class-wise feature attribution, theoretical evidence from a synthetic model, and systematic studies across architectures.

Result: Early AT learns cross-class features for robustness, while later stages shift to class-specific features, linking to robust overfitting and soft-label training advantages.

Conclusion: The findings refine AT understanding, offering new perspectives on its mechanisms and properties like robust overfitting.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A semi-automated pipeline (GPDSSM) using CT scans and landmarks improves dysplasia classification accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional angle-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of hip dysplasia is crucial for preventing osteoarthritis, but current methods are time-consuming and less accurate.

Method: Developed GPDSSM, combining Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with diffeomorphism, using 192 CT scans (100 training, 92 testing).

Result: GPDSSM achieved 96.2% AUC, outperforming angle-based methods (91.2%), and identified dysplastic variations in hip surfaces.

Conclusion: GPDSSM enhances dysplasia classification accuracy and reduces clinician workload by automating measurements and 2D scan interpretation.

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

*Hyeongwon Jang, Changhun Kim, Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TIMING, a method to improve time series explainability by enhancing Integrated Gradients with temporal awareness, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods for time series overlook directional impact and fail to evaluate it properly, leading to suboptimal identification of critical points.

Method: Proposes TIMING, an enhancement of Integrated Gradients (IG) that incorporates temporal awareness to address IG's limitations in time series data.

Result: TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines, validated by novel metrics (CPD and CPP).

Conclusion: TIMING effectively addresses the limitations of conventional IG in time series XAI, providing better identification of significant points.

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

Motivation: To address open questions and counterintuitive behaviors in RL for long-context reasoning, focusing on sample roles, data efficiency, and performance stability.

Method: Systematic analysis of sample roles, strategies like relative length rewards and offline sample injection for data efficiency, and multiple evaluation runs for stability.

Result: Negative samples enhance generalization; data inefficiency identified in policy optimization; instability linked to ambiguous problems, mitigated by multiple evaluations.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into RL training, suggesting practical improvements for efficiency, robustness, and stability in reasoning models.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Motivation: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is essential for efficient resource allocation and timely intervention.

Method: ALFIA uses a modular, attention-based architecture with LoRA adapters and adaptive layer-weighting to fuse multi-layer BERT features, trained on the cw-24 benchmark.

Result: ALFIA surpasses tabular classifiers in AUPRC and integrates with GBDTs (ALFIA-boost) or neural networks (ALFIA-nn) for further gains.

Conclusion: ALFIA provides a robust tool for risk stratification in critical care, leveraging clinical text for early warnings.

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced
precision-recall profile. The embeddings produced by ALFIA's fusion module,
capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro
networks as ALFIA-nn, yielding additional performance gains. Our experiments
confirm ALFIA's superior early-warning performance, by operating directly on
routine clinical text, it furnishes clinicians with a convenient yet robust
tool for risk stratification and timely intervention in critical-care settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces \name, a method using tree sampling to estimate step-level rewards for LLMs, improving reasoning performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods lack fine-grained reward signals for intermediate reasoning steps, limiting LLM performance.

Method: \name estimates step-level rewards via tree sampling and uses group-relative rewards from GRPO, providing dense reward signals.

Result: \name boosts Qwen-2.5-Math's Pass@1 accuracy from 19.0% to 35.5% and outperforms GRPO by 2.9% while reducing response length by 18.1%.

Conclusion: \name enhances LLM reasoning by providing fine-grained rewards, improving both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness

Motivation: To reduce complexity in industrial automation and align with human-centric, sustainable, and resilient principles of Industry 5.0.

Method: A conceptual framework using intent-based processing to decompose high-level goals into actionable tasks for specialized sub-agents.

Result: Proof of concept using CMAPSS dataset and Google ADK shows feasibility in predictive maintenance, reducing technical barriers.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable, intent-driven automation, though data quality and explainability remain challenges.

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,
intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FPTQuant introduces lightweight function-preserving transforms to enable efficient INT4 quantization of LLMs without performance degradation, achieving up to 3.9x speed-up over FP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) consume significant compute and energy during inference. Naive quantization degrades performance due to outliers, necessitating a method to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency.

Method: FPTQuant uses four novel transforms: pre-RoPE for queries/keys, value transforms, MLP scaling, and dynamic scaling. These reshape activations for quantization-friendliness without custom kernels or inference overhead.

Result: FPTQuant achieves INT4 quantization with minimal overhead, offering a 3.9x speed-up over FP while maintaining accuracy comparable to slower methods.

Conclusion: FPTQuant provides an effective accuracy-speed trade-off, outperforming prior work and demonstrating practical efficiency for LLM inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAR contrastive loss to address degree bias in GNNs by adding more positive pairs and adaptive weighting, validated by the SHARP framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer from degree bias in node classification, and existing GCL methods provide insufficient/noisy information for low-degree nodes.

Method: Proposes HAR contrastive loss, which adds positive pairs using labels and adaptively weights pairs based on learning hardness. SHARP framework extends HAR.

Result: SHARP outperforms baselines on four datasets, improving performance globally and across degree levels.

Conclusion: HAR and SHARP effectively mitigate degree bias in GNNs, enhancing node classification performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Cautious Optimism,' a framework accelerating no-regret learning in general games by adaptively pacing FTRL, achieving near-optimal regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To show that adaptive pacing for no-regret learning is not isolated and can be generalized to improve learning speed in games.

Method: Proposes Cautious Optimism, a framework that accelerates any FTRL instance with minimal overhead, retaining uncoupledness.

Result: Achieves near-optimal O_T(log T) regret in self-play and optimal O(sqrt(T)) in adversarial settings.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a novel, non-monotonic approach to fast learning in general games, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stable, parallelizable version of the Mesa layer for RNNs, derived from an in-context loss, achieving better performance in language modeling at the cost of higher inference compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of transformers (linear scaling of memory and compute) and unify recent RNN models (DeltaNet, Mamba, xLSTM) by deriving their dynamics from an in-context regression objective.

Method: Proposes a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable Mesa layer, optimized using a fast conjugate gradient solver for in-context loss minimization at every time step.

Result: Achieves lower perplexity and higher downstream performance than previous RNNs, especially in long-context tasks, but requires additional inference compute.

Conclusion: The work aligns with trends of increasing test-time compute for performance gains, here by solving sequential optimization within the network.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

*John Collins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MPP encoding is a method for representing geospatial shapes as vectors using scaled distances to reference points, outperforming rasterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable the use of vector-mode geospatial data (points, lines, polygons) in machine learning by encoding shapes into vectors that capture their geometric properties.

Method: MultiPoint Proximity (MPP) encoding, which uses scaled distances from a shape to reference points within a region of interest.

Result: MPP encoding is shape-centric, continuous, differentiates spatial objects, and captures pairwise spatial relationships better than rasterization.

Conclusion: MPP encoding is superior to rasterization for encoding geospatial data for machine learning.

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

*Kuang He, Wei Tang, Tong Wei, Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates foundation models in partial label learning (PLL), proposes PartialCLIP for efficient fine-tuning, and highlights performance trends and limitations in current PLL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLL addresses datasets with inexact supervision, but existing methods overlook foundation models' potential. This work fills the gap by evaluating their impact.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8 datasets under 3 scenarios, plus proposing PartialCLIP for fine-tuning.

Result: Foundation models boost PLL performance; approaches show similar results, stability across ambiguity levels, but depend on model selection and adaptation. PartialCLIP proves effective.

Conclusion: Current PLL methods have limitations; foundation models and PartialCLIP offer promising directions for more generalizable PLL solutions.

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

*Haifeng Sun, Yu Xiong, Runze Wu, Xinyu Cai, Changjie Fan, Lan Zhang, Xiang-Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fast-DataShapley is a one-pass training method for efficiently calculating Shapley values of training data without retraining, improving performance and speed significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to fairly reward data providers and protect their rights while addressing the computational inefficiency of existing Shapley value methods.

Method: Leverages weighted least squares to train a reusable explainer model, with three methods to reduce training overhead via utility approximation and group calculation.

Result: Performance improved by 2.5x, and training speed increased by two orders of magnitude on image datasets.

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley offers an efficient, scalable solution for evaluating data contributions in AI, balancing fairness and computational feasibility.

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: iN2V extends node2vec to work inductively, improving node classification by 1-6 points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the transductive limitation of node2vec by enabling embeddings for unseen nodes.

Method: Combines post-hoc embedding computation for new nodes with modified N2V training.

Result: Improves node classification by 1 point on average, up to 6 points in some cases.

Conclusion: iN2V is a versatile, plug-in approach for inductive node representation learning.

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

*Viet Nguyen Changjian Shui, Vijay Giri, Siddarth Arya, Amol Verma, Fahad Razak, Rahul G. Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D3M monitors model performance post-deployment by detecting shifts in data distribution, ensuring timely retraining without labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of identifying when to retrain models in dynamic environments without label access.

Method: Proposes D3M, a monitoring algorithm using predictive model disagreement to detect performance deterioration.

Result: Achieves low false positives and high true positives, validated on benchmark and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: D3M is effective for alerting in high-stakes ML pipelines, ensuring model reliability.

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes test-time scaling paradigms for LLMs, comparing sample efficiency of strategies like self-consistency and best-of-$n$, and introduces a theoretical framework for self-correction with verifier feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding of test-time strategies in LLMs.

Method: Theoretical analysis of sample efficiency for repeated sampling strategies and expressiveness of self-correction with verifier feedback.

Result: Self-consistency requires Θ(1/Δ²) samples, while best-of-$n$ needs Θ(1/Δ). Self-correction enables Transformers to simulate online learning over experts.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights and empirical validation for self-correction methods, extending Transformer capabilities to multi-task settings.

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

### [511] [NIMO: a Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05059)
*Shijian Xu, Marcello Massimo Negri, Volker Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NIMO combines neural networks with linear models to maintain interpretability while improving predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks are powerful but hard to interpret, while linear models are interpretable but less expressive. NIMO aims to merge these strengths.

Method: NIMO uses a neural network to learn nonlinear corrections to a linear model, optimizing via profile likelihood and adaptive ridge regression for sparsity.

Result: NIMO recovers interpretable linear coefficients and outperforms other hybrid models in predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: NIMO successfully balances interpretability and performance, making it a practical choice for interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes two techniques—difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay—to improve data efficiency in RL fine-tuning for LLMs, reducing training time by 25%-65%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL fine-tuning for LLMs is resource-intensive, and existing work overlooks data efficiency.

Method: Uses adaptive difficulty for online data selection and an attention-based framework for efficient difficulty estimation. Introduces rollout replay to reuse recent rollouts.

Result: Reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25%-65% while matching performance of the original GRPO algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly enhance data efficiency in RL fine-tuning for LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

*Marten Lienen, Abdullah Saydemir, Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends HiPPO theory to handle measurement noise, providing an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space models without runtime overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HiPPO assumes noise-free data, which is often unrealistic; this work addresses noise in the data for better model robustness.

Method: Reformulates HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem, treating data as noisy outputs of a latent system, and derives a posterior-based initialization.

Result: Improves noise resistance in state-space models during training and inference.

Conclusion: The proposed initialization enhances robustness to noise while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grafting enables efficient exploration of new diffusion model architectures by editing pretrained models, achieving competitive quality with minimal compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating architectural decisions in diffusion models is costly due to pretraining requirements. Grafting leverages pretrained models to study new designs affordably.

Method: Grafting edits pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to test hybrid designs (e.g., replacing attention with gated convolution) and restructuring architectures (e.g., parallel blocks).

Result: Hybrid designs achieve near-original quality (FID: 2.38-2.64) with <2% pretraining compute. Grafting also speeds up text-to-image models (1.43x) with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: Grafting is a practical approach for exploring diffusion model architectures, enabling efficient operator replacement and restructuring without full pretraining.

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

TL;DR: Proposes a kernelized KL divergence estimator with importance sampling to improve stability and reduce bias in semi-implicit variational inference, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of high variance and bias in KL divergence training for semi-implicit variational inference in high dimensions.

Method: Introduces a kernelized KL divergence estimator with nonparametric smoothing and importance sampling correction, linked theoretically to Stein variational gradient descent.

Result: Achieves lower gradient variance and benign bias, leading to more stable and efficient optimization, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art SIVI methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances training stability and efficiency in semi-implicit variational inference, demonstrating superior empirical performance.

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Synthetic data's privacy depends on the generative model and can amplify privacy when the model is hidden. The paper studies this in linear regression, showing risks if the adversary controls the seed but privacy benefits with random inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously understand privacy amplification in synthetic data, which lacks theoretical grounding despite empirical evidence.

Method: Investigates privacy implications using the linear regression framework, analyzing scenarios with adversary-controlled seeds and random inputs.

Result: Negative results show seed control leaks as much as releasing the model, while random inputs amplify privacy beyond the model's guarantees.

Conclusion: The findings in linear regression provide a foundation for future general privacy bounds in synthetic data.

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Conclusion: The system is suitable for resource-constrained environments, upholding privacy and collaborative learning principles.

Abstract: Recently, federated learning frameworks such as Python TestBed for Federated

have emerged to tackle user privacy concerns and efficiency in embedded
systems. Even more recently, an efficient federated anomaly detection
algorithm, FLiForest, based on Isolation Forests has been developed, offering a
low-resource, unsupervised method well-suited for edge deployment and
continuous learning. In this paper, we present an application of Isolation
Forest-based temperature anomaly detection, developed using the previously
mentioned federated learning frameworks, aimed at small edge devices and IoT
systems running MicroPython. The system has been experimentally evaluated,
achieving over 96% accuracy in distinguishing normal from abnormal readings and
above 78% precision in detecting anomalies across all tested configurations,
while maintaining a memory usage below 160 KB during model training. These
results highlight its suitability for resource-constrained environments and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the universal properties and stability of associative memory and diffusion models, especially in the transition from generation to memory as noise levels decrease.

Method: Uses Morse-Smale dynamical systems as universal approximators for gradient-based associative memory and diffusion models, analyzing their structural stability and bifurcations.

Result: Shows stability in associative memory and diffusion models at vanishing noise levels, with generic bifurcations marking transitions between stable systems.

Conclusion: The framework provides insights into the stability and transitions in associative memory and diffusion models, with applications to Hopfield networks and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

Motivation: Diffusion-based re-ranking loses discriminative power over distance; LPMT aims to preserve locality while enabling global retrieval.

Method: LPMT uses Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion (BCD) for similarity propagation and Locality State Embedding (LSE) for local consistency, connected via Thermodynamic Markovian Transition (TMT).

Result: LPMT improves instance retrieval performance across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: LPMT effectively balances local and global retrieval needs, enhancing accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

### [520] [Diagonal Batching Unlocks Parallelism in Recurrent Memory Transformers for Long Contexts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05229)
*Danil Sivtsov, Ivan Rodkin, Gleb Kuzmin, Yuri Kuratov, Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diagonal Batching improves RMTs by enabling parallel execution across segments, reducing inference time and cost without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models face inefficiencies in long-context inference due to quadratic time and linear memory complexity. RMTs reduce this but introduce sequential bottlenecks.

Method: Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme, allows parallelism in RMTs while maintaining exact recurrence, eliminating sequential constraints.

Result: Diagonal Batching achieves a 3.3x speedup over standard LLaMA-1B and 1.8x over sequential RMT on 131,072-token sequences.

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching makes RMTs more practical for real-world long-context applications by reducing latency and cost.

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

*Gen Li, Yuchen Jiao, Yu Huang, Yuting Wei, Yuxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a universal approximation theory for transformers, showing they can perform in-context learning without fine-tuning, extending beyond traditional optimization-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers enable in-context learning and provide theoretical guarantees for their universal approximation capabilities.

Method: Constructs transformers that can predict tasks from in-context examples without weight updates, using universal function approximation instead of optimization algorithms.

Result: Demonstrates transformers can reliably perform in-context learning for any function class, beyond convex or linear problems.

Conclusion: The work highlights transformers' ability to learn general-purpose representations and adapt dynamically to in-context examples, offering broader theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

### [522] [Learning Theory of Decentralized Robust Kernel-Based Learning Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05215)
*Zhan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm in RKHS is proposed, unifying robust regression with rigorous convergence analysis and optimal learning rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing distributed robust kernel learning schemes by introducing a decentralized framework that enhances robustness and convergence.

Method: Utilizes a networked system represented as a connected graph, employing a robust loss function and kernel-based integral operator techniques for decentralized learning.

Result: Demonstrates optimal learning rates and high confidence convergence bounds for local estimators in mean square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error.

Conclusion: The algorithm effectively balances robustness and convergence, with the scaling parameter σ playing a key role in performance.

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

*Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zhuoming Chen, Haizhong Zheng, Yang Zhou, Emma Strubell, Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges traditional test-time scaling laws, showing smaller models' effectiveness is overestimated due to overlooked memory bottlenecks. It introduces the Kinetics Scaling Law, emphasizing computation and memory costs, and proposes sparse attention for better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work ignores memory access bottlenecks in inference-time strategies, leading to overestimation of smaller models' effectiveness. The study aims to provide a more accurate scaling law for resource allocation.

Method: The authors analyze models from 0.6B to 32B parameters, introducing the Kinetics Scaling Law. They propose sparse attention to reduce per-token costs and enable longer generations.

Result: Sparse attention models outperform dense ones, with 60+ points gains in low-cost and 5+ points in high-cost regimes on AIME.

Conclusion: Sparse attention is crucial for test-time scaling, as it improves accuracy through increased generation, unlike parameter scaling in training.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

### [524] [A Unified Framework for Provably Efficient Algorithms to Estimate Shapley Values](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05216)
*Tyler Chen, Akshay Seshadri, Mattia J. Villani, Pradeep Niroula, Shouvanik Chakrabarti, Archan Ray, Pranav Deshpande, Romina Yalovetzky, Marco Pistoia, Niraj Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for Shapley value estimators, including KernelSHAP, and provides the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP. It validates the approach with experiments and improves scalability for high-dimensional datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact Shapley value computation is computationally expensive, and existing estimators lack theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: A unified framework for Shapley value estimators is proposed, encompassing KernelSHAP and related methods. Theoretical guarantees are proven, and improvements for scalability are implemented.

Result: The framework achieves low mean squared error with modest sample sizes and outperforms KernelSHAP on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP, validates the framework experimentally, and enhances scalability for high-dimensional datasets.

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

*Adrian Łańcucki, Konrad Staniszewski, Piotr Nawrot, Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS) to compress KV caches in Transformer LLMs, enabling more tokens per compute budget and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache size bottlenecks generation cost, not token count. Compressing the KV cache can enhance accuracy without increasing compute.

Method: Proposes DMS, a KV cache sparsification method requiring minimal training (1K steps) for 8× compression, delaying token eviction to preserve information.

Result: DMS boosts accuracy (e.g., 9.1 points on AIME 24) while maintaining runtime and memory efficiency across LLM families.

Conclusion: Inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS is practical and effective for improving LLM accuracy without extra compute cost.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

*Severi Rissanen, RuiKang OuYang, Jiajun He, Wenlin Chen, Markus Heinonen, Arno Solin, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PTSD combines diffusion models with MCMC to improve neural samplers, outperforming diffusion-based methods in efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural samplers lag behind MCMC methods like PT in efficiency, and PT has drawbacks like dependent samples and high computational costs for new samples.

Method: PTSD trains diffusion models sequentially across temperatures, using PT's advantages. It combines high-temperature models to generate approximate samples, refined with MCMC for training the next model.

Result: PTSD generates well-mixed, uncorrelated samples efficiently, improving target evaluation efficiency over diffusion-based neural samplers.

Conclusion: PTSD effectively bridges the gap between neural samplers and MCMC, offering a more efficient and reusable sampling method.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for interpretability, identifies limitations in shallow architectures, and proposes a multi-iteration SAE (MP-SAE) to handle correlated features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quasi-orthogonality assumption in shallow SAEs that limits extraction of correlated features.

Method: Introduces a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE) for residual-guided feature extraction.

Result: MP-SAE enables extraction of correlated features in hierarchical settings (e.g., MNIST) with guaranteed monotonic reconstruction improvement.

Conclusion: MP-SAE advances SAEs by overcoming limitations of shallow architectures, improving feature extraction for interpretability.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

*Yizhuo Li, Yuying Ge, Yixiao Ge, Ying Shan, Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework aligns latent spaces to target distributions using flow-based generative models, avoiding expensive likelihood evaluations and ODE solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align learnable latent spaces with arbitrary target distributions efficiently, leveraging flow-based models as priors.

Method: Pretrains a flow model on target features, then regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss derived from flow matching.

Result: The alignment loss approximates the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution, validated in controlled and large-scale experiments.

Conclusion: The framework offers a computationally efficient and theoretically grounded approach for latent space alignment.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the convergence behavior of a single-layer Transformer with self-attention, feedforward networks, and residual connections, showing linear convergence under proper initialization and the stabilizing role of residual connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Transformers' empirical success, their theoretical foundations, especially training dynamics, are underdeveloped. This paper aims to understand the interdependencies of Transformer components and the role of residual connections.

Method: The study examines a structurally complete single-layer Transformer, analyzing gradient descent convergence under specific initialization. It also extends findings to multi-layer architectures.

Result: Gradient descent achieves linear convergence, influenced by the attention layer's output matrix singular values. Residual connections mitigate ill-conditioning from softmax's low-rank structure, enhancing stability.

Conclusion: Residual connections improve optimization stability in Transformers, and gradient descent converges linearly under proper initialization, with empirical validation supporting the theory.

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

TL;DR: RHEL is a learning algorithm for Hamiltonian systems, matching BPTT performance without explicit Jacobian computation, enabling scalable, energy-efficient sequence modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop physics-grounded learning algorithms for dynamical systems, adhering to core physical principles and enabling efficient simulation.

Method: Proposes Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), which computes gradients as finite differences of Hamiltonian trajectories, requiring only three forward passes. Introduces Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs) and Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs).

Result: RHEL matches BPTT performance on time-series tasks with sequences up to ~50k, demonstrating scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: RHEL enables scalable, energy-efficient physical systems with self-learning capabilities for sequence modeling, bridging physics and ML.

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication bottlenecks in distributed learning due to compressed information exchange degrade convergence, motivating the need for precise analysis of error feedback methods.

Method: The study uses Lyapunov functions to derive tight convergence rates for EF and EF²¹, with matching lower bounds, in a simplified setting for clarity.

Result: The analysis yields sharp performance guarantees and enables a rigorous comparison between EF, EF²¹, and compressed gradient descent.

Conclusion: The principled approach provides clear theoretical insights and fair comparisons, highlighting the effectiveness of error feedback schemes.

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

Motivation: Current methods struggle with precise modifications in time series while preserving temporal coherence, limiting practical applications.

Method: Introduces CocktailEdit, using confidence-weighted anchor control for point-wise constraints and classifier-based control for segment-level properties.

Result: Achieves precise local control during denoising, maintaining coherence, and integrates with diffusion-based models, validated across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Bridges generative modeling and real-world editing needs, offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

TL;DR: Reservoir computing can generalize to unexplored state space regions without structural priors, using a multiple-trajectory training scheme for multistable systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning struggles to generalize without structural priors, especially for dynamics poorly represented in training data.

Method: A multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers, applied to multistable systems.

Result: RCs trained on single-basin trajectories generalize to unobserved basins.

Conclusion: Reservoir computing enables out-of-domain generalization in dynamical systems without explicit priors.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

TL;DR: SAILOR improves imitation learning by teaching agents to recover from mistakes using a world model and reward model, outperforming BC methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral cloning (BC) fails when agents deviate from expert demonstrations, lacking recovery strategies. SAILOR addresses this by enabling independent reasoning.

Method: SAILOR combines a world model and reward model to plan and recover from mistakes, ensuring stable learning without additional human corrections.

Result: SAILOR outperforms state-of-the-art BC methods across visual manipulation tasks, even with 5-10x more BC demonstrations.

Conclusion: SAILOR effectively handles nuanced failures and reward hacking, demonstrating robust performance in imitation learning.

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is

### [535] [Power Law Guided Dynamic Sifting for Efficient Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05300)
*Nirav Koley, Prajwal Singhania, Abhinav Bhatele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SiftAttention replaces top-$k$ operations with efficient element-wise filtering to reduce GPU memory bandwidth usage in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address memory bandwidth limitations in GPU inference for large language models, particularly during attention computations.

Method: Proposes SiftAttention, which uses dynamic threshold-based filtering to reduce data movement between HBM and SRAM.

Result: Preserves model quality better than existing methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage.

Conclusion: SiftAttention offers a more efficient and effective solution for approximate attention in GPU-based inference.

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

*Florentin Guth, Zahra Kadkhodaie, Eero P Simoncelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework for learning normalized energy models inspired by diffusion generative models, using dual score matching objectives, achieves state-of-the-art cross-entropy on ImageNet64 and demonstrates strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning probability models from data is challenging due to dimensionality. The paper aims to address this by introducing a normalized energy model framework.

Method: Modifies a score network architecture to compute energy, optimizing with denoising and a novel secondary objective for consistent energies across noise levels.

Result: Achieves comparable cross-entropy to state-of-the-art on ImageNet64 and shows strong generalization with nearly independent log probabilities of training images.

Conclusion: The energy model framework effectively learns probability distributions, generalizes well, and reveals variations in image probability and dimensionality, challenging traditional assumptions.

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LSM-2 with AIM introduces a self-supervised learning approach for handling incomplete wearable sensor data without imputation, achieving top performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of missing data in wearable sensor applications, where traditional SSL models fail due to reliance on complete inputs.

Method: Uses Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM) with learnable mask tokens to model missingness, pre-trained on 40M hours of multimodal sensor data.

Result: Achieves best performance in classification, regression, and generative tasks, with robust scaling and high performance under targeted missingness.

Conclusion: AIM is a reliable solution for real-world wearable data, especially in clinical scenarios like hypertension prediction.

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

*Yingshuai Ji, Haomin Zhuang, Matthew Toole, James McKenzie, Xiaolong Liu, Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An AI-based framework for extracting single-scatterer QPI patterns from multi-scatterer images, using a two-step learning strategy for robust inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting the single-scatterer QPI pattern (kernel) from multi-scatterer images is an ill-posed inverse problem, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: A two-step learning strategy: (1) train a variational autoencoder to learn a latent space of kernels, (2) align QPI observations with pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder.

Result: The method achieves higher accuracy and better generalization to unseen kernels compared to a one-step baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed AI framework effectively addresses the QPI kernel extraction problem, offering improved performance and robustness.

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

*Chaofan Pan, Lingfei Ren, Yihui Feng, Linbo Xiong, Wei Wei, Yonghao Li, Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MT-Core enhances continual RL by combining coarse-grained (LLM-driven) and fine-grained (RL-driven) policy learning for better knowledge transfer across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CRL methods focus on fine-grained knowledge transfer, neglecting multi-granularity human cognitive control, limiting transfer across diverse tasks.

Method: MT-Core uses LLMs for coarse-grained goal-setting and RL for fine-grained policy learning, supported by a retrievable policy library.

Result: MT-Core outperforms baselines in handling diverse CRL tasks.

Conclusion: MT-Core's multi-granularity approach improves knowledge transfer in continual RL.

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) empowers RL agents with the ability to
learn a sequence of tasks, accumulating knowledge learned in the past and using
the knowledge for problemsolving or future task learning. However, existing
methods often focus on transferring fine-grained knowledge across similar
tasks, which neglects the multi-granularity structure of human cognitive
control, resulting in insufficient knowledge transfer across diverse tasks. To
enhance coarse-grained knowledge transfer, we propose a novel framework called
MT-Core (as shorthand for Multi-granularity knowledge Transfer for Continual
reinforcement learning). MT-Core has a key characteristic of multi-granularity
policy learning: 1) a coarsegrained policy formulation for utilizing the
powerful reasoning ability of the large language model (LLM) to set goals, and
2) a fine-grained policy learning through RL which is oriented by the goals. We
also construct a new policy library (knowledge base) to store policies that can
be retrieved for multi-granularity knowledge transfer. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MT-Core in handling diverse CRL
tasks versus popular baselines.

### [540] [Scaling Trends in Language Model Robustness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18213)
*Nikolaus Howe, Ian McKenzie, Oskar Hollinsworth, Michał Zajac, Tom Tseng, Aaron Tucker, Pierre-Luc Bacon, Adam Gleave*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Larger language models don't inherently improve robustness without safety training, but scale aids adversarial training efficiency. Attack success scales with compute, and while attacks currently outpace defenses, larger adversarially trained models may favor defense long-term.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how model size and compute affect robustness against adversarial attacks, given the growing capabilities and vulnerabilities of large language models.

Method: A scaling approach is used to study robustness across classification tasks, model families, and adversarial attacks, including adversarial training and attack compute scaling.

Result: Larger models aren't consistently more robust without safety training. Scale improves adversarial training sample efficiency but worsens compute efficiency. Attack success increases with compute, and defense might gain an advantage with larger adversarially trained models.

Conclusion: Scaling provides insights into robustness, showing attacks currently outpace defenses, but larger adversarially trained models could shift the balance in favor of defense.

Abstract: Increasing model size has unlocked a dazzling array of capabilities in modern
language models. At the same time, even frontier models remain vulnerable to
jailbreaks and prompt injections, despite concerted efforts to make them
robust. As both attack and defense gain access to more compute, and as models
become larger, what happens to robustness? We argue that to answer this
question requires a \emph{scaling} approach, which we employ in an extensive
study of language model robustness across several classification tasks, model
families, and adversarial attacks. We find that in the absence of explicit
safety training, larger models are not consistently more robust; however, scale
improves sample efficiency in adversarial training, though it worsens compute
efficiency. Further, we find that increasing attack compute smoothly improves
attack success rate against both undefended and adversarially trained models.
Finally, after exploring robustness transfer across attacks and threat models,
we combine attack and defense scaling rates to study the offense-defense
balance. We find that while attack scaling outpaces adversarial training across
all models studied, larger adversarially trained models might give defense the
advantage in the long run. These results underscore the utility of the scaling
lens, and provide a paradigm for evaluating future attacks and defenses on
frontier models.

*Thomas Chen, Patrícia Muñoz Ewald*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows how standard gradient flow in deep learning can be adapted to yield constrained Euclidean gradient flow in output space, achieving global minima under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve gradient flow dynamics in deep learning, ensuring convergence to global minima for common loss functions.

Method: Deforming standard gradient flow into an adapted version, reparametrizing time for linear interpolation under full-rank Jacobian conditions.

Result: For $L^{2}$ loss, linear interpolation leads to a global minimum; for cross-entropy loss, an explicit formula for the unique global minimum is derived.

Conclusion: The adapted gradient flow framework provides theoretical guarantees for achieving global minima under specific conditions, enhancing understanding of training dynamics.

Abstract: We prove that the standard gradient flow in parameter space that underlies
many training algorithms in deep learning can be continuously deformed into an
adapted gradient flow which yields (constrained) Euclidean gradient flow in
output space. Moreover, for the $L^{2}$ loss, if the Jacobian of the outputs
with respect to the parameters is full rank (for fixed training data), then the
time variable can be reparametrized so that the resulting flow is simply linear
interpolation, and a global minimum can be achieved. For the cross-entropy
loss, under the same rank condition and assuming the labels have positive
components, we derive an explicit formula for the unique global minimum.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combining SVGD with evolution strategy (ES) improves gradient-free sampling from unnormalized distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVGD relies on gradients, which may not always be available; existing gradient-free methods have limitations.

Method: Integrate SVGD steps with ES updates to avoid gradient dependency.

Result: Produces high-quality samples without gradients, outperforming prior gradient-free SVGD methods.

Conclusion: The hybrid SVGD-ES approach is effective for gradient-free sampling in challenging problems.

Abstract: Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a highly efficient method to
sample from an unnormalized probability distribution. However, the SVGD update
relies on gradients of the log-density, which may not always be available.
Existing gradient-free versions of SVGD make use of simple Monte Carlo
approximations or gradients from surrogate distributions, both with
limitations. To improve gradient-free Stein variational inference, we combine
SVGD steps with evolution strategy (ES) updates. Our results demonstrate that
the resulting algorithm generates high-quality samples from unnormalized target
densities without requiring gradient information. Compared to prior
gradient-free SVGD methods, we find that the integration of the ES update in
SVGD significantly improves the performance on multiple challenging benchmark
problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep Ensembles boost performance but unevenly benefit groups, termed the 'disparate benefits effect.' This affects fairness metrics, with predictive diversity differences explaining it. Hardt post-processing mitigates the effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Deep Ensembles impact algorithmic fairness, especially across socially relevant groups defined by protected attributes.

Method: Empirical analysis using facial analysis and medical imaging datasets with protected group attributes, examining fairness metrics like statistical parity and equal opportunity.

Result: Deep Ensembles exhibit disparate benefits across groups, explained by per-group predictive diversity differences. Hardt post-processing effectively mitigates this.

Conclusion: Deep Ensembles' fairness impact must be considered, and Hardt post-processing is a viable solution to address the disparate benefits effect.

Abstract: Ensembles of Deep Neural Networks, Deep Ensembles, are widely used as a
simple way to boost predictive performance. However, their impact on
algorithmic fairness is not well understood yet. Algorithmic fairness examines
how a model's performance varies across socially relevant groups defined by
protected attributes such as age, gender, or race. In this work, we explore the
interplay between the performance gains from Deep Ensembles and fairness. Our
analysis reveals that they unevenly favor different groups, a phenomenon that
we term the disparate benefits effect. We empirically investigate this effect
using popular facial analysis and medical imaging datasets with protected group
attributes and find that it affects multiple established group fairness
metrics, including statistical parity and equal opportunity. Furthermore, we
identify that the per-group differences in predictive diversity of ensemble
members can explain this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that the classical
Hardt post-processing method is particularly effective at mitigating the
disparate benefits effect of Deep Ensembles by leveraging their
better-calibrated predictive distributions.

TL;DR: Transformers with RoPE develop wavelet-like properties to overcome positional encoding limits, enabling multi-resolution processing akin to wavelet transforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how RoPE-based Transformers compensate for positional encoding limitations by evolving wavelet-like behaviors.

Method: Analyzed model scales, architectures, and training checkpoints to observe attention heads' evolution into multi-resolution processors.

Result: RoPE uniquely enables scale-invariant behavior, emerging in distinct training phases and adhering to the uncertainty principle.

Conclusion: Modern Transformers' effectiveness lies in their ability to spontaneously develop optimal multi-resolution decompositions.

Abstract: This paper studies how Transformer models with Rotary Position Embeddings
(RoPE) develop emergent, wavelet-like properties that compensate for the
positional encoding's theoretical limitations. Through an analysis spanning
model scales, architectures, and training checkpoints, we show that attention
heads evolve to implement multi-resolution processing analogous to wavelet
transforms. We demonstrate that this scale-invariant behavior is unique to
RoPE, emerges through distinct evolutionary phases during training, and
statistically adheres to the fundamental uncertainty principle. Our findings
suggest that the effectiveness of modern Transformers stems from their
remarkable ability to spontaneously develop optimal, multi-resolution
decompositions to address inherent architectural constraints.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Context is Key' (CiK), a benchmark for time-series forecasting that combines numerical data with textual context, showing LLM-based methods outperform others when integrating both modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human forecasters use contextual information beyond numerical data, but current LLM-based models struggle to integrate this effectively. CiK aims to bridge this gap.

Method: CiK pairs numerical data with crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both. A simple LLM prompting method is proposed and tested against statistical and time-series models.

Result: The proposed LLM method outperforms others on CiK, highlighting the value of contextual information but also revealing LLM shortcomings.

Conclusion: CiK advances multimodal forecasting by emphasizing the need for models to integrate textual context, making them more accessible and accurate for decision-makers.

Abstract: Forecasting is a critical task in decision-making across numerous domains.
While historical numerical data provide a start, they fail to convey the
complete context for reliable and accurate predictions. Human forecasters
frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge and
constraints, which can efficiently be communicated through natural language.
However, in spite of recent progress with LLM-based forecasters, their ability
to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To
address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time-series forecasting
benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted
textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities; crucially,
every task in CiK requires understanding textual context to be solved
successfully. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models,
time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple
yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on
our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating
contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based
forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. This
benchmark aims to advance multimodal forecasting by promoting models that are
both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical
expertise. The benchmark can be visualized at

TL;DR: LRAM, a large recurrent action model with xLSTM, offers fast inference and competitive performance compared to Transformers in RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers in RL have slow inference, making them impractical for real-time applications like robotics. Modern recurrent architectures (e.g., xLSTM, Mamba) offer faster inference while maintaining training efficiency.

Method: Proposed LRAM with xLSTM core for linear-time inference and sequence length extrapolation. Evaluated on 432 tasks across 6 domains.

Result: LRAM matches Transformers in performance and outperforms them in speed.

Conclusion: Modern recurrent architectures like xLSTM are viable for large action models, offering practical benefits for real-time RL applications.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a trend in the field of Reinforcement
Learning (RL) towards large action models trained offline on large-scale
datasets via sequence modeling. Existing models are primarily based on the
Transformer architecture, which result in powerful agents. However, due to slow
inference times, Transformer-based approaches are impractical for real-time
applications, such as robotics. Recently, modern recurrent architectures, such
as xLSTM and Mamba, have been proposed that exhibit parallelization benefits
during training similar to the Transformer architecture while offering fast
inference. In this work, we study the aptitude of these modern recurrent
architectures for large action models. Consequently, we propose a Large
Recurrent Action Model (LRAM) with an xLSTM at its core that comes with
linear-time inference complexity and natural sequence length extrapolation
abilities. Experiments on 432 tasks from 6 domains show that LRAM compares
favorably to Transformers in terms of performance and speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIT (Focus Instruction Tuning) trains LLMs to focus on specific features, improving robustness, fairness, and control by conditioning responses on desired attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address misalignment and spurious feature reliance in LLMs by embedding intrinsic steering mechanisms.

Method: Introduces FIT, which trains models to condition responses on specified features while ignoring others.

Result: FIT successfully steers behavior, enhances robustness, mitigates bias, and generalizes to unseen features.

Conclusion: FIT provides a lightweight, intrinsic solution for more controllable and fair LLMs.

Abstract: Despite the success of Instruction Tuning (IT) in training large language
models (LLMs), such models often leverage spurious or biased features learnt
from their training data and can become misaligned, leading to undesired
behaviours. While existing techniques can steer model behaviour at
inference-time, they are often post-hoc and do not embed steering as an
intrinsic model feature. In this work, we introduce Focus Instruction Tuning
(FIT), which trains LLMs to condition their responses by focusing on specific
features whilst ignoring others, leading to different behaviours based on what
features are specified. Across diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate that FIT: (i)
successfully steers behaviour at inference time; (ii) increases robustness by
amplifying core task signals and down-weighting spurious cues; (iii) mitigates
social bias by suppressing demographic attributes; and (iv) generalises under
distribution shifts and to previously unseen focus features. FIT therefore
offers a lightweight, intrinsic mechanism for building more robust, fair, and
easily controllable LLMs.

*Lifan Zhao, Yanyan Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proceed is a proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting that addresses concept drift by estimating and adapting to drift between training and test samples, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online learning methods for time series forecasting overlook the temporal gap between training samples and test samples, leading to outdated model adaptations.

Method: Proceed estimates concept drift between recent training samples and the current test sample, then uses an adaptation generator to adjust model parameters proactively. It is trained on synthetic diverse drifts for generalization.

Result: Proceed outperforms state-of-the-art online learning methods across five real-world datasets, enhancing forecast model resilience against concept drift.

Conclusion: Proceed effectively mitigates concept drift in online time series forecasting by proactively adapting models, offering significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where
data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model
performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually
organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update
model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However,
they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each
sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a
temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical
analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast
models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present Proceed, a
novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting.
Proceed first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training
samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to
efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments,
proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the
generalization capability of the framework, Proceed is trained on synthetic
diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets
across various forecast models demonstrate that Proceed brings more performance
improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly
facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts. Code is

TL;DR: HashEvict compresses the KV cache in LLMs using LSH, reducing GPU memory usage by 30%-70% without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The KV cache in LLMs consumes significant GPU memory, necessitating efficient compression methods.

Method: HashEvict uses LSH to identify and replace dissimilar tokens pre-attention, leveraging binarized Gaussian projections and Hamming distance.

Result: Achieves 30%-70% KV cache compression while maintaining performance in reasoning, retrieval, and summarization tasks.

Conclusion: HashEvict offers a dynamic, pre-attention solution for efficient KV cache compression in LLMs.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) use the key-value (KV) cache
to significantly accelerate inference by storing the key and value embeddings
of past tokens. However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this
work, we introduce HashEvict, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing
(LSH) to compress the KV cache. HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache
that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by
computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the
current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much
smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary
structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing
compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention,
HashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational
costs. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and
value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to
produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress
the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning,
multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.

*Mason Kamb, Surya Ganguli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains how convolutional diffusion models achieve creativity despite theoretical predictions of memorization, identifying locality and equivariance as key biases. It introduces interpretable models (LS and ELS) that predict diffusion model outputs accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile the gap between theory (predicting memorization) and practice (observing creativity) in diffusion models by identifying underlying inductive biases.

Method: Identifies locality and equivariance as inductive biases, develops local score (LS) and equivariant local score (ELS) machines, and validates them on datasets like CIFAR10 and CelebA.

Result: The models achieve high predictive accuracy (median $r^2$ up to 0.96) and reveal a patch mosaic mechanism for creativity. Attention in UNets is also partially explained.

Conclusion: The study provides a mechanistic understanding of creativity in diffusion models, highlighting the role of local patch mixing and attention in generating novel images.

Abstract: We obtain an analytic, interpretable and predictive theory of creativity in
convolutional diffusion models. Indeed, score-matching diffusion models can
generate highly original images that lie far from their training data. However,
optimal score-matching theory suggests that these models should only be able to
produce memorized training examples. To reconcile this theory-experiment gap,
we identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1)
induce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching;
(2) result in fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, local
score (LS) and equivariant local score (ELS) machines that, (3) after
calibrating a single time-dependent hyperparameter can quantitatively predict
the outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like ResNets and
UNets) with high accuracy (median $r^2$ of $0.95, 0.94, 0.94, 0.96$ for our top
model on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, MNIST, and CelebA). Our model reveals a locally
consistent patch mosaic mechanism of creativity, in which diffusion models
create exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local
training set patches at different scales and image locations. Our theory also
partially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention enabled UNets
(median $r^2 \sim 0.77$ on CIFAR10), revealing an intriguing role for attention
in carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.

TL;DR: CUSP integrates spectral and curvature signals in graph representation learning, outperforming state-of-the-art models by up to 5.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance graph representation learning by combining the strengths of spectral filtering and non-Euclidean geometries (hyperbolic and spherical manifolds).

Method: Proposes Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (CUSP) with three novel components: Cusp Laplacian, Cusp Filtering, and Cusp Pooling.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows CUSP's superiority in node classification and link prediction tasks.

Conclusion: CUSP effectively unifies spectral and curvature insights, advancing graph representation learning.

Abstract: Can integrating spectral and curvature signals unlock new potential in graph
representation learning? Non-Euclidean geometries, particularly Riemannian
manifolds such as hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive
curvature), offer powerful inductive biases for embedding complex graph
structures like scale-free, hierarchical, and cyclic patterns. Meanwhile,
spectral filtering excels at processing signal variations across graphs, making
it effective in homophilic and heterophilic settings. Leveraging both can
significantly enhance the learned representations. To this end, we propose
Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (CUSP) - the first graph
representation learning paradigm that unifies both CUrvature (geometric) and
SPectral insights. CUSP is a mixed-curvature spectral GNN that learns spectral
filters to optimize node embeddings in products of constant-curvature manifolds
(hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean). Specifically, CUSP introduces three
novel components: (a) Cusp Laplacian, an extension of the traditional graph
Laplacian based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature, designed to capture the curvature
signals better; (b) Cusp Filtering, which employs multiple Riemannian graph
filters to obtain cues from various bands in the eigenspectrum; and (c) Cusp
Pooling, a hierarchical attention mechanism combined with a curvature-based
positional encoding to assess the relative importance of differently curved
substructures in our graph. Empirical evaluation across eight homophilic and
heterophilic datasets demonstrates the superiority of CUSP in node
classification and link prediction tasks, with a gain of up to 5.3% over
state-of-the-art models. The code is available at:

### [552] [Representations Shape Weak-to-Strong Generalization: Theoretical Insights and Empirical Predictions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00620)
*Yihao Xue, Jiping Li, Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Weak-to-Strong Generalization (W2SG) using kernel methods to analyze interactions between weak and strong models, offering insights into performance gaps and error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how weak models can supervise stronger ones, analogous to human guidance of superhuman AI, is crucial for advancing AI alignment and generalization.

Method: The study uses kernel methods derived from principal components of models' internal representations to define a space capturing learnable gaps between weak and strong models.

Result: The proposed kernel-based framework quantifies performance gaps and predicts W2SG trends without labels, validated on molecular predictions and NLP tasks.

Conclusion: The theory provides practical metrics for W2SG, highlighting how strong models can overcome weak supervision limitations, with implications for AI alignment.

Abstract: Weak-to-Strong Generalization (W2SG), where a weak model supervises a
stronger one, serves as an important analogy for understanding how humans might
guide superhuman intelligence in the future. Promising empirical results
revealed that a strong model can surpass its weak supervisor. While recent work
has offered theoretical insights into this phenomenon, a clear understanding of
the interactions between weak and strong models that drive W2SG remains
elusive. We investigate W2SG through a theoretical lens and show that it can be
characterized using kernels derived from the principal components of weak and
strong models' internal representations. These kernels can be used to define a
space that, at a high level, captures what the weak model is unable to learn
but is learnable by the strong model. The projection of labels onto this space
quantifies how much the strong model falls short of its full potential due to
weak supervision. This characterization also provides insights into how certain
errors in weak supervision can be corrected by the strong model, regardless of
overfitting. Our theory has significant practical implications, providing a
representation-based metric that predicts W2SG performance trends without
requiring labels, as shown in experiments on molecular predictions with
transformers and 5 NLP tasks involving 52 LLMs.

### [553] [Analytical Lyapunov Function Discovery: An RL-based Generative Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02014)
*Haohan Zou, Jie Feng, Hao Zhao, Yuanyuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transformer-based framework to generate and verify analytical Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamical systems, addressing scalability and interpretability issues in neural network approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural network methods for Lyapunov functions struggle with scalable verification and interpretability, limiting their practical utility for control engineers.

Method: The framework uses a transformer-based trainer to generate candidate Lyapunov functions and a falsifier for verification and refinement via risk-seeking policy gradient. It is trained from scratch with RL, focusing on local Lyapunov functions for high-dimensional systems.

Result: The approach successfully finds local Lyapunov functions for high-dimensional and non-polynomial systems, outperforming prior methods and discovering previously unidentified functions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework simplifies formal verification, enhances interpretability, and provides practical insights for control engineering, demonstrating effectiveness on systems up to ten dimensions.

Abstract: Despite advances in learning-based methods, finding valid Lyapunov functions
for nonlinear dynamical systems remains challenging. Current neural network
approaches face two main issues: challenges in scalable verification and
limited interpretability. To address these, we propose an end-to-end framework
using transformers to construct analytical Lyapunov functions (local), which
simplifies formal verification, enhances interpretability, and provides
valuable insights for control engineers. Our framework consists of a
transformer-based trainer that generates candidate Lyapunov functions and a
falsifier that verifies candidate expressions and refines the model via
risk-seeking policy gradient. Unlike Alfarano et al. (2024), which utilizes
pre-training and seeks global Lyapunov functions for low-dimensional systems,
our model is trained from scratch via reinforcement learning (RL) and succeeds
in finding local Lyapunov functions for high-dimensional and non-polynomial
systems. Given the analytical nature of the candidates, we employ efficient
optimization methods for falsification during training and formal verification
tools for the final verification. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach
on a range of nonlinear dynamical systems with up to ten dimensions and show
that it can discover Lyapunov functions not previously identified in the
control literature. Full implementation is available on

*Carles Balsells-Rodas, Xavier Sumba, Tanmayee Narendra, Ruibo Tu, Gabriele Schweikert, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Yingzhen Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDCI is a causal discovery method for nonstationary time series, outperforming baselines and showing promise for forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery methods struggle with nonstationary time series and fully observed variables. SDCI addresses these limitations.

Method: SDCI models nonstationary behavior as conditionally stationary, using latent state variables to recover causal dependencies.

Result: SDCI outperforms baseline methods on nonlinear particle interaction data, gene regulatory networks, and NBA player movement modeling.

Conclusion: SDCI demonstrates the potential of causality-driven methods for forecasting and handling complex time series data.

Abstract: Causal discovery, i.e., inferring underlying causal relationships from
observational data, is highly challenging for AI systems. In a time series
modeling context, traditional causal discovery methods mainly consider
constrained scenarios with fully observed variables and/or data from stationary
time-series. We develop a causal discovery approach to handle a wide class of
nonstationary time series that are conditionally stationary, where the
nonstationary behaviour is modeled as stationarity conditioned on a set of
latent state variables. Named State-Dependent Causal Inference (SDCI), our
approach is able to recover the underlying causal dependencies, with provable
identifiablity for the state-dependent causal structures. Empirical experiments
on nonlinear particle interaction data and gene regulatory networks demonstrate
SDCI's superior performance over baseline causal discovery methods. Improved
results over non-causal RNNs on modeling NBA player movements demonstrate the
potential of our method and motivate the use of causality-driven methods for
forecasting.

*Hee-Jun Jung, Jaehyoung Jeong, Kangil Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIPE-transformation to improve disentanglement learning in VAEs by combining invertible, partial-equivariant transformations and exponential family conversions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentanglement learning in VAEs lacks clear implementation of inductive bias, which is crucial for understanding and reusing trained information.

Method: Proposes MIPE-transformation: 1) IPE-transformation for invertibility and partial-equivariance, 2) EF-conversion for flexible priors/posters, and 3) integrating and training multiple units.

Result: MIPE-transformation enhances disentanglement performance on 3D Cars, 3D Shapes, and dSprites datasets compared to state-of-the-art VAEs.

Conclusion: MIPE-transformation effectively injects inductive bias, improving disentanglement in VAEs.

Abstract: Disentanglement learning is a core issue for understanding and re-using
trained information in Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), and effective inductive
bias has been reported as a key factor. However, the actual implementation of
such bias is still vague. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called
Multiple Invertible and partial-equivariant transformation
(MIPE-transformation), to inject inductive bias by 1) guaranteeing the
invertibility of latent-to-latent vector transformation while preserving a
certain portion of equivariance of input-to-latent vector transformation,
called Invertible and partial-equivariant transformation (IPE-transformation),
2) extending the form of prior and posterior in VAE frameworks to an
unrestricted form through a learnable conversion to an approximated exponential
family, called Exponential Family conversion (EF-conversion), and 3)
integrating multiple units of IPE-transformation and EF-conversion, and their
training. In experiments on 3D Cars, 3D Shapes, and dSprites datasets,
MIPE-transformation improves the disentanglement performance of
state-of-the-art VAEs.

### [556] [Policy learning "without" overlap: Pessimism and generalized empirical Bernstein's inequality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09900)
*Ying Jin, Zhimei Ren, Zhuoran Yang, Zhaoran Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pessimistic Policy Learning (PPL) optimizes lower confidence bounds of policy values without requiring uniform overlap, ensuring efficient learning even with diminishing propensities for suboptimal actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing policy learning methods rely on unrealistic uniform overlap assumptions, especially with evolving behavior policies. PPL addresses this limitation.

Method: PPL uses lower confidence bounds (LCBs) of policy values, leveraging behavior policy knowledge, and employs Majorization-Minimization and policy tree search for optimization.

Result: PPL achieves data-dependent suboptimality bounds, requiring only overlap for optimal policies and policy class complexity, not uniform overlap.

Conclusion: PPL is effective for offline policy learning, particularly with adaptive data collection, and is supported by theory and empirical results.

Abstract: This paper studies offline policy learning, which aims at utilizing
observations collected a priori (from either fixed or adaptively evolving
behavior policies) to learn an optimal individualized decision rule that
achieves the best overall outcomes for a given population. Existing policy
learning methods rely on a uniform overlap assumption, i.e., the propensities
of exploring all actions for all individual characteristics must be lower
bounded. As one has no control over the data collection process, this
assumption can be unrealistic in many situations, especially when the behavior
policies are allowed to evolve over time with diminishing propensities for
certain actions.
  In this paper, we propose Pessimistic Policy Learning (PPL), a new algorithm
that optimizes lower confidence bounds (LCBs) -- instead of point estimates --
of the policy values. The LCBs are constructed using knowledge of the behavior
policies for collecting the offline data. Without assuming any uniform overlap
condition, we establish a data-dependent upper bound for the suboptimality of
our algorithm, which only depends on (i) the overlap for the optimal policy,
and (ii) the complexity of the policy class we optimize over. As an
implication, for adaptively collected data, we ensure efficient policy learning
as long as the propensities for optimal actions are lower bounded over time,
while those for suboptimal ones are allowed to diminish arbitrarily fast. In
our theoretical analysis, we develop a new self-normalized type concentration
inequality for inverse-propensity-weighting estimators, generalizing the
well-known empirical Bernstein's inequality to unbounded and non-i.i.d. data.
We complement our theory with an efficient optimization algorithm via
Majorization-Minimization and policy tree search, as well as extensive
simulation studies and real-world applications that demonstrate the efficacy of
PPL.

*Oliver Urs Lenz, Henri Bollaert, Chris Cornelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates NN, FNN, and FRNN classifiers, standardizes weighting methods, and identifies optimal configurations for each, with FRNN outperforming NN and FNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively evaluate and compare classical, fuzzy, and fuzzy rough nearest neighbor classification methods, standardize weighting approaches, and identify optimal configurations.

Method: Standardized weighting with kernel functions, tested on 85 datasets with various distance and scaling measures.

Result: Optimal performance: NN and FRNN with Samworth weights and specific scaling; FNN with Samworth distance-weights. FRNN outperforms NN and FNN.

Conclusion: FRNN is superior, with simpler Yager weights as an alternative for NN. Standardized weighting and scaling improve performance.

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive and large-scale evaluation of classical
(NN), fuzzy (FNN) and fuzzy rough (FRNN) nearest neighbour classification. We
standardise existing proposals for nearest neighbour weighting with kernel
functions, applied to the distance values and/or ranks of the nearest
neighbours of a test instance. In particular, we show that the theoretically
optimal Samworth weights converge to a kernel. Kernel functions are closely
related to fuzzy negation operators, and we propose a new kernel based on Yager
negation. We also consider various distance and scaling measures, which we show
can be related to each other. Through a systematic series of experiments on 85
real-life classification datasets, we find that NN, FNN and FRNN all perform
best with Boscovich distance, and that NN and FRNN perform best with a
combination of Samworth rank- and distance-weights and scaling by the mean
absolute deviation around the median ($r_1$), the standard deviation ($r_2$) or
the semi-interquartile range ($r_{\infty}^*$), while FNN performs best with
only Samworth distance-weights and $r_1$- or $r_2$-scaling. However, NN
achieves comparable performance with Yager-$\frac{1}{2}$ distance-weights,
which are simpler to implement than a combination of Samworth distance- and
rank-weights. Finally, FRNN generally outperforms NN, which in turn performs
systematically better than FNN.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates six LLMs' understanding of Intermediate Representations (IRs) in compiler design, identifying strengths in syntax parsing but weaknesses in instruction-level reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how well LLMs comprehend IRs, a critical but underexplored aspect in compiler design and program analysis.

Method: An empirical study assessing six LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3, DeepSeek, Gemma 2, Llama 3, Code Llama) on four tasks: control flow graph reconstruction, decompilation, code summarization, and execution reasoning.

Result: LLMs perform well in parsing IR syntax and high-level structures but struggle with instruction-level reasoning, particularly in control flow, loops, and dynamic execution. Common failures include misinterpretation of branching and heuristic reasoning.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for IR-specific improvements in LLMs, recommending fine-tuning on structured IR datasets and control-flow-sensitive architectures.

Abstract: Intermediate Representations (IRs) play a critical role in compiler design
and program analysis, yet their comprehension by Large Language Models (LLMs)
remains underexplored. In this paper, we present an explorative empirical study
evaluating the capabilities of six state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3,
DeepSeek, Gemma 2, Llama 3, and Code Llama, in understanding IRs. Specifically,
we assess model performance across four core tasks: control flow graph
reconstruction, decompilation, code summarization, and execution reasoning.
While LLMs exhibit competence in parsing IR syntax and identifying high-level
structures, they consistently struggle with instruction-level reasoning,
especially in control flow reasoning, loop handling, and dynamic execution.
Common failure modes include misinterpreting branching instructions, omitting
critical operations, and relying on heuristic reasoning rather than precise
instruction-level logic. Our findings highlight the need for IR-specific
enhancements in LLM design. We recommend fine-tuning on structured IR datasets
and integrating control-flow-sensitive architectures to improve model
effectiveness. All experimental data and source code are publicly available at

*Tianyi Zhang, Yu Cao, Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UEFL is a federated learning framework that dynamically adapts to data silos with divergent distributions by extending a discretization codebook based on uncertainty, improving accuracy and reducing uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of data heterogeneity in federated learning, where models struggle with new silos having significantly different distributions.

Method: Proposes UEFL, which maps latent features to trainable discrete vectors, assesses uncertainty, and extends the codebook for high-uncertainty silos.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by 3%--22.1% and reducing uncertainty by 38.83%--96.24%.

Conclusion: UEFL effectively handles data diversity in federated learning with minimal computational overhead, enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL), aimed at leveraging vast distributed datasets,
confronts a crucial challenge: the heterogeneity of data across different
silos. While previous studies have explored discrete representations to enhance
model generalization across minor distributional shifts, these approaches often
struggle to adapt to new data silos with significantly divergent distributions.
In response, we have identified that models derived from FL exhibit markedly
increased uncertainty when applied to data silos with unfamiliar distributions.
Consequently, we propose an innovative yet straightforward iterative framework,
termed \emph{Uncertainty-Based Extensible-Codebook Federated Learning (UEFL)}.
This framework dynamically maps latent features to trainable discrete vectors,
assesses the uncertainty, and specifically extends the discretization
dictionary or codebook for silos exhibiting high uncertainty. Our approach aims
to simultaneously enhance accuracy and reduce uncertainty by explicitly
addressing the diversity of data distributions, all while maintaining minimal
computational overhead in environments characterized by heterogeneous data
silos. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that UEFL
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in
accuracy (by 3\%--22.1\%) and uncertainty reduction (by 38.83\%--96.24\%). The

*Karish Grover, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Christos Faloutsos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CurvGAD introduces a mixed-curvature graph autoencoder to detect geometric anomalies in networks, outperforming existing methods by up to 6.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph anomaly detection methods overlook geometric outliers, focusing only on structural and attribute-level anomalies.

Method: CurvGAD uses two pipelines: (1) curvature-equivariant geometry reconstruction and (2) curvature-invariant structure and attribute reconstruction, leveraging mixed-curvature Riemannian encoders and Ollivier-Ricci flow.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 6.5% on 10 real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CurvGAD successfully identifies curvature-driven anomalies, refining anomaly classifications and improving detection accuracy.

Abstract: Does the intrinsic curvature of complex networks hold the key to unveiling
graph anomalies that conventional approaches overlook? Reconstruction-based
graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods overlook such geometric outliers,
focusing only on structural and attribute-level anomalies. To this end, we
propose CurvGAD - a mixed-curvature graph autoencoder that introduces the
notion of curvature-based geometric anomalies. CurvGAD introduces two parallel
pipelines for enhanced anomaly interpretability: (1) Curvature-equivariant
geometry reconstruction, which focuses exclusively on reconstructing the edge
curvatures using a mixed-curvature, Riemannian encoder and Gaussian
kernel-based decoder; and (2) Curvature-invariant structure and attribute
reconstruction, which decouples structural and attribute anomalies from
geometric irregularities by regularizing graph curvature under discrete
Ollivier-Ricci flow, thereby isolating the non-geometric anomalies. By
leveraging curvature, CurvGAD refines the existing anomaly classifications and
identifies new curvature-driven anomalies. Extensive experimentation over 10
real-world datasets (both homophilic and heterophilic) demonstrates an
improvement of up to 6.5% over state-of-the-art GAD methods. The code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model for bionic prosthesis control uses human locomotion demonstrations to predict missing limb kinematics, outperforming baselines in diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lower limb amputations and neuromuscular impairments limit mobility, requiring advanced prosthetics that replicate human movement dynamics.

Method: The approach uses multitask prospective rehearsal to anticipate and refine movements, combining task-specific modules on a shared backbone.

Result: The model outperforms baselines in real-world gait datasets, especially under distributional shifts and noise.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive model enhances bionic limb effectiveness by accurately predicting kinematics in varied locomotion tasks.

Abstract: Lower limb amputations and neuromuscular impairments severely restrict
mobility, necessitating advancements beyond conventional prosthetics. While
motorized bionic limbs show promise, their effectiveness depends on replicating
the dynamic coordination of human movement across diverse environments. In this
paper, we introduce a model for human behavior in the context of bionic
prosthesis control. Our approach leverages human locomotion demonstrations to
learn the synergistic coupling of the lower limbs, enabling the prediction of
the kinematic behavior of a missing limb during tasks such as walking, climbing
inclines, and stairs. We propose a multitasking, continually adaptive model
that anticipates and refines movements over time. At the core of our method is
a technique called multitask prospective rehearsal, that anticipates and
synthesizes future movements based on the previous prediction and employs a
corrective mechanism for subsequent predictions. Our evolving architecture
merges lightweight, task-specific modules on a shared backbone, ensuring both
specificity and scalability. We validate our model through experiments on
real-world human gait datasets, including transtibial amputees, across a wide
range of locomotion tasks. Results demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms baseline models, particularly in scenarios with distributional
shifts, adversarial perturbations, and noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies multiclass list classification with semi-bandit feedback, presenting an algorithm for PAC learning with improved sample complexity and computational efficiency. It also addresses regret minimization in adversarial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon existing bounds for combinatorial semi-bandits and bridge the gap between bandit and full-information feedback in multiclass classification.

Method: Designs an algorithm for the PAC variant of the problem, leveraging ERM oracles, and analyzes sample complexity and regret bounds.

Result: Achieves improved sample complexity bounds, especially when the number of true labels is small, and matches full-information rates in certain regimes. Also provides efficient regret minimization in adversarial settings.

Conclusion: Bandit feedback can be nearly cost-free in specific scenarios, and the results generalize prior work, offering broader applicability to contextual combinatorial semi-bandit problems.

Abstract: We study the problem of multiclass list classification with (semi-)bandit
feedback, where input examples are mapped into subsets of size $m$ of a
collection of $K$ possible labels. In each round of the interaction, the
learner observes feedback consisting of the predicted labels which lie in some
underlying set of ground truth labels associated with the given example. Our
main result is for the $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PAC variant of the problem for
which we design an algorithm that returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal hypothesis
with high probability using a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O} \big(
(\mathrm{poly}(K/m) + sm / \varepsilon^2) \log (|H|/\delta) \big)$ where $H$ is
the underlying (finite) hypothesis class and $s$ is an upper bound on the
number of true labels for a given example. This bound improves upon known
bounds for combinatorial semi-bandits whenever $s \ll K$. Moreover, in the
regime where $s = O(1)$ the leading terms in our bound match the corresponding
full-information rates, implying that bandit feedback essentially comes at no
cost. Our PAC learning algorithm is also computationally efficient given access
to an ERM oracle for $H$. In the special case of single-label classification
corresponding to $s=m=1$, we prove a sample complexity bound of $O \big((K^7 +
1/\varepsilon^2)\log (|H|/\delta)\big)$ which improves upon recent results in
this scenario (Erez et al. '24). Additionally, we consider the regret
minimization setting where data can be generated adversarially, and establish a
regret bound of $\widetilde O(|H| + \sqrt{smT \log |H|})$. Our results
generalize and extend prior work in the simpler single-label setting (Erez et
al. '24), and apply more generally to contextual combinatorial semi-bandit
problems with $s$-sparse rewards.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Token merging, especially local merging, improves efficiency in time series analysis for transformers and state-space models, offering linear complexity and causal merging for decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational inefficiency in processing long token sequences for time series analysis.

Method: Introduce local merging, a domain-specific algorithm that combines tokens within a local neighborhood, adjusting complexity and enabling causal merging.

Result: Achieves up to 5400% acceleration with minimal accuracy impact, validated on the Chronos model.

Conclusion: Local merging is a scalable and efficient solution for long-sequence processing in time series analysis.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in subquadratic attention mechanisms or state-space
models, processing long token sequences still imposes significant computational
requirements. Token merging has emerged as a solution to increase computational
efficiency in computer vision architectures. In this work, we perform the first
investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both transformers
and state-space models. We further introduce local merging, a domain-specific
token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local
neighborhood, achieving two major benefits: a) Local merging can adjust its
computational complexity from quadratic to linear based on the neighborhood
size to effectively scale to long sequences; b) Local merging is the first
causal merging scheme enabling token merging in transformer decoders. Further,
we identify spectral properties of the input data that reliably predict the
potential benefits of local merging without requiring evaluation on downstream
tasks. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that local merging
offers substantial efficiency gains with minimal impact on accuracy, achieving
up to 5400% acceleration on the recently proposed Chronos foundation model.

*Haonan He, Peng Ye, Yuchen Ren, Yuan Yuan, Luyang Zhou, Shucun Ju, Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GoRA introduces a gradient-driven adaptive framework for low-rank adaptation (LoRA) in LLMs, dynamically optimizing rank and initialization for better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA variants often compromise usability or efficiency by focusing on either rank selection or initialization, but not both.

Method: GoRA leverages gradient information to dynamically assign ranks and initialize weights adaptively within a unified framework.

Result: GoRA outperforms standard LoRA and full fine-tuning, e.g., achieving a 5.13-point improvement in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: GoRA unifies rank and initialization adaptation, offering superior performance and efficiency compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a crucial method for efficiently fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), with its effectiveness influenced by two key
factors: rank selection and weight initialization. While numerous LoRA variants
have been proposed to improve performance by addressing one of these aspects,
they often compromise usability or computational efficiency. In this paper, we
analyze and identify the core limitations of existing approaches and propose a
novel framework -- GoRA (Gradient-driven Adaptive Low Rank Adaptation) -- that
simultaneously adapts both the rank and initialization strategy within a
unified framework. GoRA leverages gradient information during training to
dynamically assign optimal ranks and initialize low-rank adapter weights in an
adaptive manner. To our knowledge, GoRA is the first method that not only
addresses the limitations of prior approaches -- which often focus on either
rank selection or initialization in isolation -- but also unifies both aspects
within a single framework, enabling more effective and efficient adaptation.
Extensive experiments across various architectures and modalities show that
GoRA consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based methods while preserving the
efficiency of vanilla LoRA. For example, when fine-tuning Llama3.1-8B-Base for
mathematical reasoning, GoRA achieves a 5.13-point improvement over standard
LoRA and even outperforms full fine-tuning by 2.05 points under high-rank
settings.

*Zhiqiang Cai, Yu Cao, Yuanfei Huang, Xiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework using weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate iid samples from invariant distributions of Itô diffusion, avoiding biases and computational costs of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for sampling invariant distributions from Itô diffusion are biased and computationally expensive. Deep learning-based methods don't directly address sampling from computed densities.

Method: Uses WGS with a loss function based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows and randomized test functions to avoid min-max optimization.

Result: Effective and scalable sampling with low computational costs, capable of exploring multiple metastable states.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for sampling invariant distributions.

Abstract: Sampling invariant distributions from an It\^o diffusion process presents a
significant challenge in stochastic simulation. Traditional numerical solvers
for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a
lengthy simulation period, resulting in biased and correlated samples. The
current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck
equation to determine the invariant probability density function in the form of
deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of
sampling from the computed density function. In this work, we introduce a
framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate
independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a
transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation. Our
proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck
equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant
distribution and facilitate sample generation from a base distribution. Our
randomized test function circumvents the need for min-max optimization in the
traditional weak formulation. Our method necessitates neither the
computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the
invertibility of the transformation map. A crucial component of our framework
is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian
kernel functions with centers related to the generated data samples.
Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the
effectiveness and scalability of our method, which offers both low
computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable
states.

### [566] [Regularized KL-Divergence for Well-Defined Function-Space Variational Inference in Bayesian neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04317)
*Tristan Cinquin, Robert Bamler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of infinite ELBO in function-space VI for BNNs by proposing a solution using generalized VI and regularized KL divergence, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BNNs need principled uncertainty estimates, but weight-space priors are hard to define. Function-space VI approaches face issues like infinite ELBO.

Method: Uses generalized VI with regularized KL divergence to create a well-defined variational objective for function-space inference in BNNs with GP priors.

Result: The method successfully incorporates GP prior properties on synthetic and real-world data, providing competitive uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: The proposed solution is the first well-defined variational objective for function-space VI in BNNs, outperforming baselines in uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNN) promise to combine the predictive performance
of neural networks with principled uncertainty modeling important for
safety-critical systems and decision making. However, posterior uncertainty
estimates depend on the choice of prior, and finding informative priors in
weight-space has proven difficult. This has motivated variational inference
(VI) methods that pose priors directly on the function generated by the BNN
rather than on weights. In this paper, we address a fundamental issue with such
function-space VI approaches pointed out by Burt et al. (2020), who showed that
the objective function (ELBO) is negative infinite for most priors of interest.
Our solution builds on generalized VI (Knoblauch et al., 2019) with the
regularized KL divergence (Quang, 2019) and is, to the best of our knowledge,
the first well-defined variational objective for function-space inference in
BNNs with Gaussian process (GP) priors. Experiments show that our method
incorporates the properties specified by the GP prior on synthetic and small
real-world data sets, and provides competitive uncertainty estimates for
regression, classification and out-of-distribution detection compared to BNN
baselines with both function and weight-space priors.

*Jintao Zhang, Chendong Xiang, Haofeng Huang, Jia Wei, Haocheng Xi, Jun Zhu, Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpargeAttn is a universal sparse and quantized attention method that accelerates diverse models without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention mechanisms in large models have quadratic complexity, and while sparsity can be exploited, existing methods lack universality and performance guarantees.

Method: SpargeAttn uses a two-stage online filter: first predicting the attention map to skip computations, then applying a softmax-aware filter for further efficiency.

Result: The method significantly speeds up models (language, image, video generation) while maintaining end-to-end performance.

Conclusion: SpargeAttn provides a universal solution for efficient attention, balancing speed and accuracy across diverse applications.

Abstract: An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to
its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits
sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for
the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the
sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on
optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse
patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees
both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive.
In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized
attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the
first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the
skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we
design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further
skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method
significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video
generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics. The codes are available at

*Xiaoyu Jiang, Sokratia Georgaka, Magnus Rattray, Mauricio A. Álvarez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A stochastic variational inference method is proposed for LV-MOGP to handle large output problems efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The LV-MOGP model is flexible but computationally expensive for many outputs.

Method: Stochastic variational inference with mini-batches for inputs and outputs.

Result: Reduces computational complexity per iteration, making it scalable.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient training of LV-MOGP for large-scale problems.

Abstract: The Multi-Output Gaussian Process is is a popular tool for modelling data
from multiple sources. A typical choice to build a covariance function for a
MOGP is the Linear Model of Coregionalization (LMC) which parametrically models
the covariance between outputs. The Latent Variable MOGP (LV-MOGP) generalises
this idea by modelling the covariance between outputs using a kernel applied to
latent variables, one per output, leading to a flexible MOGP model that allows
efficient generalization to new outputs with few data points. Computational
complexity in LV-MOGP grows linearly with the number of outputs, which makes it
unsuitable for problems with a large number of outputs. In this paper, we
propose a stochastic variational inference approach for the LV-MOGP that allows
mini-batches for both inputs and outputs, making computational complexity per
training iteration independent of the number of outputs.

*Michael-Andrei Panaitescu-Liess, Zora Che, Bang An, Yuancheng Xu, Pankayaraj Pathmanathan, Souradip Chakraborty, Sicheng Zhu, Tom Goldstein, Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Watermarking LLMs reduces copyrighted text generation but complicates Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). An adaptive technique is proposed to improve MIA success under watermarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about LLMs generating copyrighted material and explore watermarking as a solution.

Method: Investigate watermarking effectiveness through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, and propose an adaptive MIA technique.

Result: Watermarking reduces copyrighted content but lowers MIA success. Adaptive technique improves MIA performance.

Conclusion: Adaptive methods are needed to balance regulatory measures in LLMs with legal implications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating diverse and contextually rich text. However, concerns regarding
copyright infringement arise as LLMs may inadvertently produce copyrighted
material. In this paper, we first investigate the effectiveness of watermarking
LLMs as a deterrent against the generation of copyrighted texts. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that
incorporating watermarks into LLMs significantly reduces the likelihood of
generating copyrighted content, thereby addressing a critical concern in the
deployment of LLMs. However, we also find that watermarking can have unintended
consequences on Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to discern
whether a sample was part of the pretraining dataset and may be used to detect
copyright violations. Surprisingly, we find that watermarking adversely affects
the success rate of MIAs, complicating the task of detecting copyrighted text
in the pretraining dataset. These results reveal the complex interplay between
different regulatory measures, which may impact each other in unforeseen ways.
Finally, we propose an adaptive technique to improve the success rate of a
recent MIA under watermarking. Our findings underscore the importance of
developing adaptive methods to study critical problems in LLMs with potential
legal implications.

*Haowen Ma, Zhiguo Long, Hua Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'typicality' to improve mode-seeking in clustering, proposes TANGO for effective mode detection, and validates its superiority on synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mode-seeking methods rely on local data and manual thresholds, limiting effectiveness across datasets.

Method: Introduces 'typicality' for global perspective mode detection, designs TANGO clustering with graph-cut and path-based similarity.

Result: TANGO outperforms on synthetic and real-world datasets, with theoretical backing.

Conclusion: TANGO offers a robust, efficient solution for mode-seeking clustering, validated by experiments and theory.

Abstract: Density-based mode-seeking methods generate a \emph{density-ascending
dependency} from low-density points towards higher-density neighbors. Current
mode-seeking methods identify modes by breaking some dependency connections,
but relying heavily on local data characteristics, requiring case-by-case
threshold settings or human intervention to be effective for different
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel concept called
\emph{typicality}, by exploring the \emph{locally defined} dependency from a
\emph{global} perspective, to quantify how confident a point would be a mode.
We devise an algorithm that effectively and efficiently identifies modes with
the help of the global-view typicality. To implement and validate our idea, we
design a clustering method called TANGO, which not only leverages typicality to
detect modes, but also utilizes graph-cut with an improved \emph{path-based
similarity} to aggregate data into the final clusters. Moreover, this paper
also provides some theoretical analysis on the proposed algorithm. Experimental
results on several synthetic and extensive real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of TANGO. The code is available at

TL;DR: DRAGO improves continual model-based reinforcement learning by using synthetic experience rehearsal and intrinsic rewards to maintain knowledge across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of incremental world model development in tasks with varying rewards but shared state space and dynamics.

Method: Combines Synthetic Experience Rehearsal (generating synthetic past experiences) and Regaining Memories Through Exploration (intrinsic rewards for revisiting prior states).

Result: Empirical results show DRAGO preserves knowledge and outperforms in continual learning scenarios.

Conclusion: DRAGO effectively maintains and updates world models across diverse tasks, enhancing continual learning.

Abstract: We propose DRAGO, a novel approach for continual model-based reinforcement
learning aimed at improving the incremental development of world models across
a sequence of tasks that differ in their reward functions but not the state
space or dynamics. DRAGO comprises two key components: Synthetic Experience
Rehearsal, which leverages generative models to create synthetic experiences
from past tasks, allowing the agent to reinforce previously learned dynamics
without storing data, and Regaining Memories Through Exploration, which
introduces an intrinsic reward mechanism to guide the agent toward revisiting
relevant states from prior tasks. Together, these components enable the agent
to maintain a comprehensive and continually developing world model,
facilitating more effective learning and adaptation across diverse
environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DRAGO is able to preserve
knowledge across tasks, achieving superior performance in various continual
learning scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper critiques current methods for disentangling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in Bayesian Neural Networks, introduces Gaussian Logits as an alternative, and proposes the Disentanglement Error metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the criticism of existing methods for uncertainty disentanglement and exploring Gaussian Logits as a less-studied alternative.

Method: Conducts three experiments manipulating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in isolation, using multiple datasets and Bayesian Neural Networks approximations.

Result: Deep Ensembles with Information Theoretic disentanglement perform best but still have room for improvement.

Conclusion: The Disentanglement Error metric is introduced, and while Deep Ensembles show promise, further refinement is needed.

Abstract: Current methods for disentangling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in
classification with Bayesian Neural Networks have been receiving strong
criticism. Information Theoretic measures for aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty are not independent, due to the additivity assumption. However,
these investigations do not consider Gaussian Logits, an alternative approach
that gets less attention. In this paper, we present a set of three experiments
that manipulate the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in isolation to
benchmark the quality of disentanglement using multiple datasets. Based on
these experiments we define the Disentanglement Error as a metric for the
quality of disentanglement.
  We evaluate Information Theoretic and Gaussian Logits disentangling over
multiple Bayesian Neural Networks approximations and show that Deep Ensembles
with Information Theoretic disentanglement have the best Disentanglement Error,
but there is still room for improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based approach for computational enumerative geometry, introducing the Dynamic Range Activator (DRA) to handle recursive patterns and high variance, with interpretability revealing emergent representations of asymptotic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling and learning enumerative geometry with Transformers, particularly for computing ψ-class intersection numbers, and to explore their potential in abductive knowledge discovery.

Method: Reformulates the problem as continuous optimization, introduces DRA for recursive patterns, uses Conformal Prediction for uncertainty quantification, and employs interpretability techniques like abductive hypothesis testing.

Result: Successfully computes intersection numbers across a vast range (10^-45 to 10^45), reveals emergent internal representations of Virasoro constraints and asymptotic properties, and demonstrates non-linear learning of closed-form expressions.

Conclusion: Transformers can model complex recursive functions and asymptotic properties in enumerative geometry, offering new avenues for data-driven discovery of closed-form expressions.

Abstract: How can Transformers model and learn enumerative geometry? What is a robust
procedure for using Transformers in abductive knowledge discovery within a
mathematician-machine collaboration? In this work, we introduce a
Transformer-based approach to computational enumerative geometry, specifically
targeting the computation of $\psi$-class intersection numbers on the moduli
space of curves. By reformulating the problem as a continuous optimization
task, we compute intersection numbers across a wide value range from $10^{-45}$
to $10^{45}$. To capture the recursive nature inherent in these intersection
numbers, we propose the Dynamic Range Activator (DRA), a new activation
function that enhances the Transformer's ability to model recursive patterns
and handle severe heteroscedasticity. Given precision requirements for
computing the intersections, we quantify the uncertainty of the predictions
using Conformal Prediction with a dynamic sliding window adaptive to the
partitions of equivalent number of marked points. To the best of our knowledge,
there has been no prior work on modeling recursive functions with such a
high-variance and factorial growth. Beyond simply computing intersection
numbers, we explore the enumerative "world-model" of Transformers. Our
interpretability analysis reveals that the network is implicitly modeling the
Virasoro constraints in a purely data-driven manner. Moreover, through
abductive hypothesis testing, probing, and causal inference, we uncover
evidence of an emergent internal representation of the the large-genus
asymptotic of $\psi$-class intersection numbers. These findings suggest that
the network internalizes the parameters of the asymptotic closed-form and the
polynomiality phenomenon of intersection numbers in a non-linear manner. This
opens up new possibilities in inferring asymptotic closed-form expressions
directly from limited amount of data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in mechanistic interpretability research between simple circuits in toy tasks and features in large models.

Method: Introduces TinySQL dataset, trains models (33M-1B parameters), and applies interpretability techniques like Edge Attribution Patching and Sparse Autoencoders.

Result: Identifies minimal circuits for SQL subskills and reveals how models compose queries across layers.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for comparing interpretability methods in structured, complex settings.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research faces a gap between analyzing simple
circuits in toy tasks and discovering features in large models. To bridge this
gap, we propose text-to-SQL generation as an ideal task to study, as it
combines the formal structure of toy tasks with real-world complexity. We
introduce TinySQL, a synthetic dataset, progressing from basic to advanced SQL
operations, and train models ranging from 33M to 1B parameters to establish a
comprehensive testbed for interpretability. We apply multiple complementary
interpretability techniques, including Edge Attribution Patching and Sparse
Autoencoders, to identify minimal circuits and components supporting SQL
generation. We compare circuits for different SQL subskills, evaluating their
minimality, reliability, and identifiability. Finally, we conduct a layerwise
logit lens analysis to reveal how models compose SQL queries across layers:
from intent recognition to schema resolution to structured generation. Our work
provides a robust framework for probing and comparing interpretability methods
in a structured, progressively complex setting.

*Iulia Duta, Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPHINX is a model that infers latent hypergraph structures unsupervised from node-level signals, using clustering and sampling to enhance higher-order interaction modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Higher-order relations are crucial but hard to annotate, leading to simplified pairwise models. SPHINX addresses this gap.

Method: Uses soft clustering and $k$-subset sampling to predict hyperedge probabilities and generate explicit hypergraphs.

Result: SPHINX successfully infers interpretable hypergraphs, improving performance in trajectory prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The model enables higher-order processing in domains where annotation is difficult, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: The importance of higher-order relations is widely recognized in a large
number of real-world systems. However, annotating them is a tedious and
sometimes impossible task. Consequently, current approaches for data modelling
either ignore the higher-order interactions altogether or simplify them into
pairwise connections. In order to facilitate higher-order processing, even when
a hypergraph structure is not available, we introduce Structural Prediction
using Hypergraph Inference Network (SPHINX), a model that learns to infer a
latent hypergraph structure in an unsupervised way, solely from the final
node-level signal. The model consists of a soft, differentiable clustering
method used to sequentially predict, for each hyperedge, the probability
distribution over the nodes and a sampling algorithm that converts them into an
explicit hypergraph structure. We show that the recent advancement in
$k$-subset sampling represents a suitable tool for producing discrete
hypergraph structures, addressing some of the training instabilities exhibited
by prior works. The resulting model can generate the higher-order structure
necessary for any modern hypergraph neural network, facilitating the capture of
higher-order interaction in domains where annotating them is difficult. Through
extensive ablation studies and experiments conducted on two challenging
datasets for trajectory prediction, we demonstrate that our model is capable of
inferring suitable latent hypergraphs, that are interpretable and enhance the
final performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bilevel reinforcement learning (BRL) has emerged as a powerful framework for
aligning generative models, yet its theoretical foundations, especially sample
complexity bounds, remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first
sample complexity bound for BRL, establishing a rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ in continuous state-action spaces. Traditional MDP
analysis techniques do not extend to BRL due to its nested structure and
non-convex lower-level problems. We overcome these challenges by leveraging the
Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and the MDP structure to obtain
closed-form gradients, enabling tight sample complexity analysis. Our analysis
also extends to general bi-level optimization settings with non-convex lower
levels, where we achieve state-of-the-art sample complexity results of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ improving upon existing bounds of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Additionally, we address the computational
bottleneck of hypergradient estimation by proposing a fully first-order,
Hessian-free algorithm suitable for large-scale problems.

TL;DR: The paper critiques the use of Average Certified Radius (ACR) in Randomized Smoothing (RS), showing it's flawed and biased, and suggests an alternative metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ACR is widely used in RS for robustness guarantees, but the authors argue it's misleading and biased, motivating a reevaluation of its use.

Method: The authors theoretically and empirically demonstrate ACR's flaws, propose strategies to exploit its weaknesses, and suggest an alternative metric.

Result: They show ACR can be gamed, existing training methods degrade robustness on hard samples, and propose $p_A$ as a better metric.

Conclusion: ACR should be discontinued in RS due to its biases, and $p_A$ is recommended as a more reliable alternative.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing (RS) is popular for providing certified robustness
guarantees against adversarial attacks. The average certified radius (ACR) has
emerged as a widely used metric for tracking progress in RS. However, in this
work, for the first time we show that ACR is a poor metric for evaluating
robustness guarantees provided by RS. We theoretically prove not only that a
trivial classifier can have arbitrarily large ACR, but also that ACR is
extremely sensitive to improvements on easy samples. In addition, the
comparison using ACR has a strong dependence on the certification budget.
Empirically, we confirm that existing training strategies, though improving
ACR, reduce the model's robustness on hard samples consistently. To strengthen
our findings, we propose strategies, including explicitly discarding hard
samples, reweighing the dataset with approximate certified radius, and extreme
optimization for easy samples, to replicate the progress in RS training and
even achieve the state-of-the-art ACR on CIFAR-10, without training for
robustness on the full data distribution. Overall, our results suggest that ACR
has introduced a strong undesired bias to the field, and its application should
be discontinued in RS. Finally, we suggest using the empirical distribution of
$p_A$, the accuracy of the base model on noisy data, as an alternative metric
for RS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdvBDGen, a framework for generating stealthy, prompt-specific backdoor triggers in LLMs, highlighting the risks of adversarial backdoors in RLHF alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of RLHF for LLM alignment increases the risk of backdoors, which current methods fail to address due to detectable fixed triggers.

Method: AdvBDGen uses a generator-discriminator pair, fortified by an adversary, to create stealthy, prompt-specific backdoor triggers with minimal fine-tuning data.

Result: The framework successfully installs complex backdoors, jailbreaks LLMs, and resists removal, outperforming traditional triggers.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for stronger defenses against adversarial backdoor threats in LLM alignment.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs), the risk of backdoor
installation during alignment has increased, leading to unintended and harmful
behaviors. Existing backdoor triggers are typically limited to fixed word
patterns, making them detectable during data cleaning and easily removable
post-poisoning. In this work, we explore the use of prompt-specific paraphrases
as backdoor triggers, enhancing their stealth and resistance to removal during
LLM alignment. We propose AdvBDGen, an adversarially fortified generative
fine-tuning framework that automatically generates prompt-specific backdoors
that are effective, stealthy, and transferable across models. AdvBDGen employs
a generator-discriminator pair, fortified by an adversary, to ensure the
installability and stealthiness of backdoors. It enables the crafting and
successful installation of complex triggers using as little as 3% of the
fine-tuning data. Once installed, these backdoors can jailbreak LLMs during
inference, demonstrate improved stability against perturbations compared to
traditional constant triggers, and are more challenging to remove. These
findings underscore an urgent need for the research community to develop more
robust defenses against adversarial backdoor threats in LLM alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TSF methods lack generalizability across domains, prompting the need for TSFMs pre-trained on diverse data.

Method: Proposes TSFM-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark supporting multiple forecasting scenarios (zero-shot, few-shot, full-shot) and standardized protocols for evaluation.

Result: Extensive evaluation reveals strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of existing TSFMs, suggesting directions for future model designs.

Conclusion: TSFM-Bench provides a unified framework for assessing TSFMs, highlighting their potential and areas for improvement in generalizability.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is key functionality in numerous fields, such
as financial investment, weather services, and energy management. Although
increasingly capable TSF methods occur, many of them require domain-specific
data collection and model training and do not generalize well when applied in
other domains. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that are pre-trained on
massive heterogeneous time series data aim to overcome these limitations. The
prospects for generalizability have spurred the development of a new generation
of TSFMs. This study proposes a benchmark, TSFM-Bench, to facilitate
comprehensive and unified evaluation of TSFMs. TSFM-Bench covers a wide range
of TSFMs, including those based on large language models and those pre-trained
on time series data. TSFM-Bench supports multiple forecasting scenarios,
including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, enabling assessment across the
full range of adaptation strategies. TSFM-Bench also provides a standardized
experimental protocols for critical evaluation processes such as dataset
splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, facilitating
consistency and fairness. We report on an extensive evaluation of TSFMs across
a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and exhibiting varied
statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and
inherent limitations of existing TSFMs, and we propose potential directions for
new model designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forecasting methods ignore real-world application needs by focusing solely on minimizing prediction errors.

Method: Breaks predictions into smaller segments, dynamically weights them, and combines them to focus on regions of interest.

Result: Improved prediction accuracy and enhanced performance of end applications, tested on standard and new datasets.

Conclusion: The method bridges prediction and decision-making in practical applications, offering better forecasting systems.

Abstract: Traditional time-series forecasting often focuses only on minimizing
prediction errors, ignoring the specific requirements of real-world
applications that employ them. This paper presents a new training methodology,
which allows a forecasting model to dynamically adjust its focus based on the
importance of forecast ranges specified by the end application. Unlike previous
methods that fix these ranges beforehand, our training approach breaks down
predictions over the entire signal range into smaller segments, which are then
dynamically weighted and combined to produce accurate forecasts within a region
of interest. We tested our method on standard datasets, including a new
wireless communication dataset, and found that not only it improves prediction
accuracy but also enhances the performance of end application employing the
forecasting model. This research provides a basis for creating forecasting
systems that better connect prediction and decision-making in various practical
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage PAC-Bayesian and Sample Compress frameworks for deriving non-vacuous generalization bounds in neural networks through meta-learning.

Method: Proposes three hypernetwork architectures: (1) PAC-Bayesian encoder for posterior distribution, (2) Sample Compress encoder for dataset selection, and (3) a hybrid approach with a new Sample Compress theorem for continuous messages.

Result: Develops a meta-learning scheme with generalization guarantees for downstream predictors, exploiting encoder-decoder junction information.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach and new theorem enable tighter generalization bounds, advancing meta-learning for neural networks.

Abstract: Both PAC-Bayesian and Sample Compress learning frameworks are instrumental
for deriving tight (non-vacuous) generalization bounds for neural networks. We
leverage these results in a meta-learning scheme, relying on a hypernetwork
that outputs the parameters of a downstream predictor from a dataset input. The
originality of our approach lies in the investigated hypernetwork architectures
that encode the dataset before decoding the parameters: (1) a PAC-Bayesian
encoder that expresses a posterior distribution over a latent space, (2) a
Sample Compress encoder that selects a small sample of the dataset input along
with a message from a discrete set, and (3) a hybrid between both approaches
motivated by a new Sample Compress theorem handling continuous messages. The
latter theorem exploits the pivotal information transiting at the
encoder-decoder junction in order to compute generalization guarantees for each
downstream predictor obtained by our meta-learning scheme.

*Emiliano Penaloza, Tianyue H. Zhan, Laurent Charlin, Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CPO, a new loss function, improves CBMs by reducing sensitivity to concept mislabeling, outperforming BCE in noisy and clean datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs rely on accurate concept labels, but real-world datasets often contain mislabeled concepts, degrading performance.

Method: Introduces Concept Preference Optimization (CPO), a loss function based on Direct Preference Optimization, to mitigate mislabeling effects.

Result: CPO outperforms Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) on three datasets, showing robustness to label noise.

Conclusion: CPO effectively addresses concept mislabeling in CBMs, enhancing performance and reliability.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) propose to enhance the trustworthiness of AI
systems by constraining their decisions on a set of human-understandable
concepts. However, CBMs typically assume that datasets contain accurate concept
labels-an assumption often violated in practice, which we show can
significantly degrade performance (by 25% in some cases). To address this, we
introduce the Concept Preference Optimization (CPO) objective, a new loss
function based on Direct Preference Optimization, which effectively mitigates
the negative impact of concept mislabeling on CBM performance. We provide an
analysis of key properties of the CPO objective, showing it directly optimizes
for the concept's posterior distribution, and contrast it against Binary Cross
Entropy (BCE), demonstrating that CPO is inherently less sensitive to concept
noise. We empirically confirm our analysis by finding that CPO consistently
outperforms BCE on three real-world datasets, both with and without added label
noise. We make our code available on Github.

### [583] [Monotonic anomaly detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23158)
*Oliver Urs Lenz, Matthijs van Leeuwen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two asymmetrical distance measures, ramp and signed distance, for semi-supervised anomaly detection focusing on monotonic anomalies (high or low attribute values). Ramp distance improves performance, while signed distance works poorly on real-life data due to oversimplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for detecting anomalies with monotonic attribute values (high or low) in semi-supervised anomaly detection, where traditional methods may not suffice.

Method: Proposes two asymmetrical distance measures: ramp distance and signed distance, designed to account for monotonicity in anomalies. Evaluates them on synthetic and real-life datasets.

Result: Ramp distance outperforms traditional absolute distance in anomaly detection. Signed distance performs well on synthetic data but poorly on real-life data due to oversimplification.

Conclusion: Ramp distance is effective for monotonic anomaly detection, while signed distance is impractical for real-life scenarios due to its simplistic compensation mechanism.

Abstract: Semi-supervised anomaly detection is based on the principle that potential
anomalies are those records that look different from normal training data.
However, in some cases we are specifically interested in anomalies that
correspond to high attribute values (or low, but not both). We present two
asymmetrical distance measures that take this monotonicity into account: ramp
distance and signed distance. Through experiments on synthetic and real-life
datasets, we show that ramp distance increases anomaly detection performance
over the traditional absolute distance. While signed distance also performs
well on synthetic data, it performs substantially poorer on real-life datasets.
We argue that this is a consequence of the fact that when using signed
distance, low values of certain attributes automatically compensate for high
values of other attributes, such that anomaly detection is reduced to counting
the total attribute value sum, which is too simplistic in practice.

*Jack Sanderson, Teddy Foley, Spencer Guo, Anqi Qu, Henry Josephson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates if LLM capabilities can advance through algorithmic innovation in compute-constrained environments, proposing a framework to distinguish compute-dependent and independent innovations. Results show compute-independent innovations yield significant gains, suggesting hardware restrictions alone are insufficient for AI oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether regulatory efforts focusing on restricting computational resources can effectively govern LLM development, given potential advancements through algorithmic innovation.

Method: Proposes a framework distinguishing compute-dependent and independent innovations, quantified using Compute-Equivalent Gain (CEG). Validated experimentally with nanoGPT models.

Result: Compute-independent innovations showed significant performance gains (up to 3.5× CEG), while compute-dependent ones were detrimental at small scales but improved with larger models.

Conclusion: Hardware restrictions alone are insufficient; effective AI oversight must also address algorithmic advancements. The framework aids in forecasting AI progress.

Abstract: Regulatory efforts to govern large language model (LLM) development have
predominantly focused on restricting access to high-performance computational
resources. This study evaluates the efficacy of such measures by examining
whether LLM capabilities can advance through algorithmic innovation in
compute-constrained environments. We propose a novel framework distinguishing
compute-dependent innovations--which yield disproportionate benefits at high
compute--from compute-independent innovations, which improve efficiency across
compute scales. The impact is quantified using Compute-Equivalent Gain (CEG).
Experimental validation with nanoGPT models confirms that compute-independent
advancements yield significant performance gains (e.g., with combined CEG up to
$3.5\times$) across the tested scales. In contrast, compute-dependent
advancements were detrimental to performance at smaller experimental scales,
but showed improved CEG (on par with the baseline) as model size increased, a
trend consistent with their definition of yielding primary benefits at higher
compute. Crucially, these findings indicate that restrictions on computational
hardware, while potentially slowing LLM progress, are insufficient to prevent
all capability gains driven by algorithmic advancements. We argue that
effective AI oversight must therefore incorporate mechanisms for understanding,
anticipating, and potentially guiding algorithmic research, moving beyond a
singular focus on hardware. The proposed framework also serves as an analytical
tool for forecasting AI progress.

### [585] [Failure Modes of LLMs for Causal Reasoning on Narratives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23884)
*Khurram Yamin, Shantanu Gupta, Gaurav R. Ghosal, Zachary C. Lipton, Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with causal reasoning, relying on unreliable shortcuts like event order and parametric knowledge, and perform poorly with long narratives. Explicit causal graphs help, but chain-of-thought reasoning does not.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and understand the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in causal reasoning tasks, particularly in inferring causal relationships from narratives.

Method: Conducted controlled synthetic experiments and real-world narrative evaluations to test LLMs' causal reasoning abilities, focusing on event order, long-term reasoning, and reliance on parametric knowledge.

Result: LLMs perform poorly when events are not in causal order, struggle with long narratives, and rely too much on parametric knowledge. Explicit causal graphs improve performance, but chain-of-thought reasoning does not.

Conclusion: The study identifies precise failure modes in LLMs' causal reasoning, providing insights for future improvements in enhancing their abilities.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the causal reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs) through the representative problem of inferring causal
relationships from narratives. We find that even state-of-the-art language
models rely on unreliable shortcuts, both in terms of the narrative
presentation and their parametric knowledge. For example, LLMs tend to
determine causal relationships based on the topological ordering of events
(i.e., earlier events cause later ones), resulting in lower performance
whenever events are not narrated in their exact causal order. Similarly, we
demonstrate that LLMs struggle with long-term causal reasoning and often fail
when the narratives are long and contain many events. Additionally, we show
LLMs appear to rely heavily on their parametric knowledge at the expense of
reasoning over the provided narrative. This degrades their abilities whenever
the narrative opposes parametric knowledge. We extensively validate these
failure modes through carefully controlled synthetic experiments, as well as
evaluations on real-world narratives. Finally, we observe that explicitly
generating a causal graph generally improves performance while naive
chain-of-thought is ineffective. Collectively, our results distill precise
failure modes of current state-of-the-art models and can pave the way for
future techniques to enhance causal reasoning in LLMs.

*Nicolás Astorga, Tennison Liu, Yuanzhang Xiao, Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for autoformulation—automated creation of solver-ready optimization models from natural language—using LLMs and Monte-Carlo Tree Search, addressing challenges like hypothesis space exploration and correctness evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating real-world problems into optimization models is difficult and requires expertise; autoformulation aims to automate this process.

Method: Combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Monte-Carlo Tree Search, using symbolic pruning and LLM-based evaluation to guide search and explore formulation space efficiently.

Result: Empirical analysis shows significant performance gains from LLM-based value estimation and symbolic pruning in linear and mixed-integer programming benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses autoformulation challenges, demonstrating practical utility in optimization modeling.

Abstract: Mathematical optimization is fundamental to decision-making across diverse
domains, from operations research to healthcare. Yet, translating real-world
problems into optimization models remains a difficult task, often demanding
specialized expertise. This paper approaches the problem of
$\textit{autoformulation}$: the automated creation of solver-ready optimization
models from natural language problem descriptions. We identify three core
challenges of autoformulation: $\textit{(1)}$ the vast, problem-dependent
hypothesis space, $\textit{(2)}$ efficient and diverse exploration of this
space under uncertainty, and $\textit{(3)}$ evaluation of formulation
correctness against problem description. To address these challenges, we
present a novel method leveraging $\textit{Large Language Models}$ (LLMs) with
$\textit{Monte-Carlo Tree Search}$, exploiting the hierarchical nature of
optimization modeling to generate and systematically explore possible
formulations. To enhance search efficiency, we introduce symbolic pruning to
eliminate trivially equivalent search paths (branches), and employ LLM-based
evaluation of partial formulations to guide search. Empirical analysis on
linear and mixed-integer programming benchmarks demonstrates our method's
effectiveness, with significant performance gains from both LLM-based value
estimation and symbolic pruning techniques.

TL;DR: LEDRO, a novel method using LLMs and optimization, outperforms traditional and existing automated approaches in analog circuit design, offering better performance, speed, and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional analog circuit design is slow and expert-dependent, while existing automation methods like BO and RL are sub-optimal and costly to generalize.

Method: LEDRO combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization techniques to iteratively refine the design space for analog circuit sizing, eliminating the need for topology-specific training.

Result: LEDRO achieves an average 13% FoM improvement with 2.15x speed-up for low-complexity Op-Amps and 48% FoM improvement with 1.7x speed-up for high-complexity ones.

Conclusion: LEDRO is highly generalizable, efficient, and outperforms baselines, making it a promising solution for analog circuit design automation.

Abstract: Traditional approaches for designing analog circuits are time-consuming and
require significant human expertise. Existing automation efforts using methods
like Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are sub-optimal
and costly to generalize across different topologies and technology nodes. In
our work, we introduce a novel approach, LEDRO, utilizing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in conjunction with optimization techniques to iteratively refine the
design space for analog circuit sizing. LEDRO is highly generalizable compared
to other RL and BO baselines, eliminating the need for design annotation or
model training for different topologies or technology nodes. We conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of our proposed framework and baseline on 22 different
Op-Amp topologies across four FinFET technology nodes. Results demonstrate the
superior performance of LEDRO as it outperforms our best baseline by an average
of 13% FoM improvement with 2.15x speed-up on low complexity Op-Amps and 48%
FoM improvement with 1.7x speed-up on high complexity Op-Amps. This highlights
LEDRO's effective performance, efficiency, and generalizability.

### [588] [Latent Safety-Constrained Policy Approach for Safe Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08794)
*Prajwal Koirala, Zhanhong Jiang, Soumik Sarkar, Cody Fleming*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel offline RL method ensures safety and reward optimization using Conditional Variational Autoencoders and Constrained Reward-Return Maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline RL struggles to balance safety and performance, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: Uses Conditional Variational Autoencoders to model safety constraints, then optimizes rewards via Constrained Reward-Return Maximization with Advantage Weighted Regression.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in safety compliance and reward optimization, validated on benchmarks like autonomous driving.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances safety and performance, supported by theory and empirical results.

Abstract: In safe offline reinforcement learning (RL), the objective is to develop a
policy that maximizes cumulative rewards while strictly adhering to safety
constraints, utilizing only offline data. Traditional methods often face
difficulties in balancing these constraints, leading to either diminished
performance or increased safety risks. We address these issues with a novel
approach that begins by learning a conservatively safe policy through the use
of Conditional Variational Autoencoders, which model the latent safety
constraints. Subsequently, we frame this as a Constrained Reward-Return
Maximization problem, wherein the policy aims to optimize rewards while
complying with the inferred latent safety constraints. This is achieved by
training an encoder with a reward-Advantage Weighted Regression objective
within the latent constraint space. Our methodology is supported by theoretical
analysis, including bounds on policy performance and sample complexity.
Extensive empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets, including challenging
autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrates that our approach not only maintains
safety compliance but also excels in cumulative reward optimization, surpassing
existing methods. Additional visualizations provide further insights into the
effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of our approach.

*Penghui Qi, Zichen Liu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Wee Sun Lee, Min Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AnytimeReasoner optimizes token efficiency and flexibility in LLMs by truncating reasoning processes under sampled budgets, introducing dense rewards, and using BRPO for robust learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs optimize only final performance under fixed token budgets, hindering efficiency and flexibility.

Method: Truncates reasoning to fit sampled budgets, introduces dense rewards, decouples thinking and summary policies, and uses BRPO for variance reduction.

Result: Outperforms GRPO in mathematical reasoning tasks across all budgets, improving training and token efficiency.

Conclusion: AnytimeReasoner enhances anytime reasoning performance, offering better efficiency and flexibility under varying token constraints.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities
of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ
reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end
of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance
under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to
optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency
and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To
achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled
token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the
optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces
verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more
effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking
and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward.
Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget
Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency
of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results
in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions,
enhancing both training and token efficiency.

*Wei Bu, Uri Kol, Ziming Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies neural network training dynamics using Fokker-Planck equations, focusing on bottleneck layers of an auto-encoder, and derives related PDEs like Callan-Symanzik and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamical evolution of neural networks during training is complex due to high dimensionality. The paper aims to simplify this by analyzing bottleneck layers and comparing theoretical predictions with empirical data.

Method: Uses Fokker-Planck equations to simulate probability density evolution of weight matrices in bottleneck layers of a 2-layered auto-encoder. Compares theoretical and empirical output distributions.

Result: Derives physically relevant PDEs (Callan-Symanzik and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang) from the dynamical equations.

Conclusion: The approach provides a tractable way to study neural network dynamics and connects them to known physical equations, offering insights into training behavior.

Abstract: The dynamical evolution of a neural network during training has been an
incredibly fascinating subject of study. First principal derivation of generic
evolution of variables in statistical physics systems has proved useful when
used to describe training dynamics conceptually, which in practice means
numerically solving equations such as Fokker-Planck equation. Simulating entire
networks inevitably runs into the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we
utilize Fokker-Planck to simulate the probability density evolution of
individual weight matrices in the bottleneck layers of a simple
2-bottleneck-layered auto-encoder and compare the theoretical evolutions
against the empirical ones by examining the output data distributions. We also
derive physically relevant partial differential equations such as
Callan-Symanzik and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equations from the dynamical equation
we have.

### [591] [SUS backprop: linear backpropagation algorithm for long inputs in transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15080)
*Sergey Pankov, Georges Harik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to reduce backpropagation computation in transformers by stochastically cutting gradient flow through insignificant attention weights, achieving linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers' attention mechanism scales quadratically with sequence length, making it computationally expensive. Many attention weights are negligible, offering a chance to cut backpropagation without significant impact.

Method: Proposes a probabilistic rule to cut backpropagation through most attention weights, limiting interactions per token to a parameter $c$, reducing complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(nc)$.

Result: Empirical results show cutting ~99% of attention gradient flow (c ~25-30) increases gradient variance by only ~1% for n~2000, with variance decreasing for longer sequences.

Conclusion: This method efficiently reduces backpropagation cost, making it negligible compared to forward pass costs, especially for long sequences.

Abstract: It is straightforward to design an unbiased gradient estimator that
stochastically cuts the backpropagation flow through any part of a
computational graph. By cutting the parts that have little effect on the
computation, one can potentially save a significant amount of backpropagation
computation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient
variance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention
mechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention
becomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically
with sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very
small, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small
fraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising
targets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule
controlled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts back-propagation through most
attention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention
head. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the
attention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear
complexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical
transformer model, cutting about $99\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e.
choosing $c \sim 25-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only
about $1\%$ for $n \sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$. This approach is
amenable to efficient sparse matrix implementation, thus being promising for
making the cost of a backward pass negligible relative to the cost of a forward
pass when training a transformer model on long sequences.

TL;DR: Neural networks improved the Hadwiger-Nelson problem by discovering two novel six-colorings, the first progress in 30 years.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the Hadwiger-Nelson problem, a long-standing challenge in discrete geometry and combinatorics, using neural networks.

Method: Reformulated the problem as an optimization task with a probabilistic, differentiable loss function, enabling gradient-based exploration.

Result: Discovered two new six-colorings, advancing the off-diagonal variant of the problem.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates neural networks' potential in mathematical discovery and is applicable to other problems.

Abstract: We demonstrate how neural networks can drive mathematical discovery through a
case study of the Hadwiger-Nelson problem, a long-standing open problem at the
intersection of discrete geometry and extremal combinatorics that is concerned
with coloring the plane while avoiding monochromatic unit-distance pairs. Using
neural networks as approximators, we reformulate this mixed discrete-continuous
geometric coloring problem with hard constraints as an optimization task with a
probabilistic, differentiable loss function. This enables gradient-based
exploration of admissible configurations that most significantly led to the
discovery of two novel six-colorings, providing the first improvement in thirty
years to the off-diagonal variant of the original problem. Here, we establish
the underlying machine learning approach used to obtain these results and
demonstrate its broader applicability through additional numerical insights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large-scale RL enhances reasoning in small/mid-sized models, outperforming distillation. Math-only RL boosts math and code performance, while code-only RL further improves code tasks. A robust data pipeline and curriculum learning are key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of clear training recipes for high-performing reasoning models and the omission of key details in frontier models like DeepSeek-R1.

Method: Systematic study of RL training, starting with math-only prompts, then code-only prompts, using a robust data curation pipeline and curriculum learning.

Result: Math-only RL improves math benchmarks (+14.6%/+17.2% for 7B/14B models) and code tasks (+6.8%/+5.8%). Code-only RL further enhances code performance without degrading math results.

Conclusion: RL unlocks foundational reasoning capabilities and solves previously unsolvable problems, surpassing distillation-based models.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for
reasoning, the training recipe for building high-performing reasoning models
remains elusive. Key implementation details of frontier models, such as
DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are
often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more
effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that
large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong,
small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of
state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL
training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective
approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts.
Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the
performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% /
+17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks
(e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition,
extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks
with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data
curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable
answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains.
Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning
with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of
on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational
reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning
(e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning
ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

*Giovanni Catania, Aurélien Decelle, Cyril Furtlehner, Beatriz Seoane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how limited data affects training energy-based models for inverse problems, revealing insights into learning timescales, early stopping, and overfitting control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of limited data on training energy-based models and improve their performance in identifying interaction networks.

Method: Uses the Gaussian model to analyze training trajectories and eigenmodes, applies random matrix theory for finite data corrections, and extends findings to binary-variable models.

Result: Optimal early stopping points are identified, and finite data corrections are modeled accurately. Overfitting in discrete-variable models is improved via empirical shrinkage.

Conclusion: The framework offers strategies to manage overfitting and generalizes to arbitrary energy-based models, enhancing their practical utility.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of limited data on training pairwise energy-based
models for inverse problems aimed at identifying interaction networks.
Utilizing the Gaussian model as testbed, we dissect training trajectories
across the eigenbasis of the coupling matrix, exploiting the independent
evolution of eigenmodes and revealing that the learning timescales are tied to
the spectral decomposition of the empirical covariance matrix. We see that
optimal points for early stopping arise from the interplay between these
timescales and the initial conditions of training. Moreover, we show that
finite data corrections can be accurately modeled through asymptotic random
matrix theory calculations and provide the counterpart of generalized
cross-validation in the energy based model context. Our analytical framework
extends to binary-variable maximum-entropy pairwise models with minimal
variations. These findings offer strategies to control overfitting in
discrete-variable models through empirical shrinkage corrections, improving the
management of overfitting in energy-based generative models. Finally, we
propose a generalization to arbitrary energy-based models by deriving the
neural tangent kernel dynamics of the score function under the score-matching
algorithm.

*Adnan Oomerjee, Zafeirios Fountas, Zhongwei Yu, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the generalization limitations of Large Language Models by using Information Bottleneck theory to propose a Transformer modification that periodically rewrites the KV cache, improving reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with true abstract reasoning due to their reliance on pattern interpolation rather than extrapolation. The work aims to overcome this by leveraging Information Bottleneck theory.

Method: The authors prove decoder-only Transformers are limited in forming task-optimal representations and propose a module to periodically rewrite the KV cache, shifting focus from memorization to predictive features.

Result: The modified Transformer outperforms vanilla models with up to 3.5x more parameters and heuristic-driven pruning methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled framework for improving Transformer reasoning by manipulating memory using information theory, addressing limitations scaling alone cannot resolve.

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models struggle with
generalisation beyond their training distribution, often exhibiting
sophisticated pattern interpolation rather than true abstract reasoning
(extrapolation). In this work, we approach this limitation through the lens of
Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation
emerges from an optimal balance between input compression and retention of
predictive information in latent representations. We prove using IB theory that
decoder-only Transformers are inherently constrained in their ability to form
task-optimal sequence representations. We then use this result to demonstrate
that periodic global transformation of the internal sequence-level
representations (KV cache) is a necessary computational step for improving
Transformer generalisation in reasoning tasks. Based on these theoretical
insights, we propose a modification to the Transformer architecture, in the
form of an additional module that globally rewrites the KV cache at periodic
intervals, shifting its capacity away from memorising input prefixes and toward
encoding features most useful for predicting future tokens. Our model delivers
substantial gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both
vanilla Transformers with up to 3.5x more parameters, as well as
heuristic-driven pruning mechanisms for cache compression. Our approach can be
seen as a principled generalisation of existing KV-cache compression methods;
whereas such methods focus solely on compressing input representations, they
often do so at the expense of retaining predictive information, and thus their
capabilities are inherently bounded by those of an unconstrained model. This
establishes a principled framework to manipulate Transformer memory using
information theory, addressing fundamental reasoning limitations that scaling
alone cannot overcome.

*Rafael Elberg, Felipe del Rio, Mircea Petrache, Denis Parra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CELEBI is a self-supervised framework for improving compositional generalization in neural networks through a communication game, outperforming prior methods in efficiency and compositionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks struggle with compositional generalization, a key feature of human cognition. CELEBI aims to address this gap by inducing compositionality in learned representations.

Method: CELEBI uses a sender-receiver communication game with three mechanisms: interactive decoding, reconstruction-based imitation, and pairwise distance maximization to promote compressibility, expressivity, and efficiency.

Result: CELEBI improves message efficiency and compositionality on Shapes3D and MPI3D datasets, achieving better reconstruction accuracy and topographic similarity than prior frameworks.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that structured, generalizable communication protocols can emerge from simplicity-based inductive biases, advancing compositional generalization in neural networks.

Abstract: Compositional generalization--the ability to interpret novel combinations of
familiar elements--is a hallmark of human cognition and language. Despite
recent advances, deep neural networks still struggle to acquire this property
reliably. In this work, we introduce CELEBI (Compressive-Expressive Language
Emergence through a discrete Bottleneck and Iterated learning), a novel
self-supervised framework for inducing compositionality in learned
representations from pre-trained models, through a reconstruction-based
communication game between a sender and a receiver. Building on theories of
language emergence, we integrate three mechanisms that jointly promote
compressibility, expressivity, and efficiency in the emergent language. First,
interactive decoding incentivizes intermediate reasoning by requiring the
receiver to produce partial reconstructions after each symbol. Second, a
reconstruction-based imitation phase, inspired by iterated learning, trains
successive generations of agents to imitate reconstructions rather than
messages, enforcing a tighter communication bottleneck. Third, pairwise
distance maximization regularizes message diversity by encouraging high
distances between messages, with formal links to entropy maximization. Our
method significantly improves both the efficiency and compositionality of the
learned messages on the Shapes3D and MPI3D datasets, surpassing prior discrete
communication frameworks in both reconstruction accuracy and topographic
similarity. This work provides new theoretical and empirical evidence for the
emergence of structured, generalizable communication protocols from
simplicity-based inductive biases.

Motivation: To understand and explain unexpected behavior shifts in models like autoregressive and diffusion models, which current theories fail to address generically.

Method: Develops a unifying theory using stochastic localization samplers, applicable to both autoregressive and diffusion models without distributional assumptions.

Result: The theory explains critical windows in model behavior, improves bounds, and connects to statistical inference phenomena. Empirical validation shows critical windows coincide with model failures.

Conclusion: The work provides a simple, generic explanation for critical windows in model behavior, bridging gaps in existing theory and offering empirical validation.

Abstract: Large language models can exhibit unexpected behavior in the blink of an eye.
In a recent computer use demo, a language model switched from coding to
Googling pictures of Yellowstone, and these sudden shifts in behavior have also
been observed in reasoning patterns and jailbreaks. This phenomenon is not
unique to autoregressive models: in diffusion models, key features of the final
output are decided in narrow ``critical windows'' of the generation process. In
this work we develop a simple, unifying theory to explain this phenomenon using
the formalism of stochastic localization samplers. We show that it emerges
generically as the generation process localizes to a sub-population of the
distribution it models.
  While critical windows have been studied at length in diffusion models,
existing theory heavily relies on strong distributional assumptions and the
particulars of Gaussian diffusion. In contrast to existing work our theory (1)
applies to autoregressive and diffusion models; (2) makes no distributional
assumptions; (3) quantitatively improves previous bounds even when specialized
to diffusions; and (4) requires basic tools and no stochastic calculus or
statistical-physics-based machinery. We also identify an intriguing connection
to the all-or-nothing phenomenon from statistical inference. Finally, we
validate our predictions empirically for LLMs and find that critical windows
often coincide with failures in problem solving for various math and reasoning
benchmarks.

*Yue Wang, Qizhou Wang, Feng Liu, Wei Huang, Yali Du, Xiaojiang Du, Bo Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gradient Rectified Unlearning (GRU), a method to improve LLM unlearning by minimizing trade-offs between removing unwanted responses and retaining general functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trade-off between unlearning privacy/copyright-related responses and maintaining general functionality in LLMs is a significant challenge.

Method: Proposes GRU, a framework that regulates gradient update directions during unlearning to reduce side effects on unrelated responses.

Result: GRU demonstrates practical effectiveness across established unlearning benchmarks.

Conclusion: GRU offers a general and effective solution to mitigate the trade-off in LLM unlearning.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated its essential role in
removing privacy and copyright-related responses, crucial for their legal and
safe applications. However, the pursuit of complete unlearning often comes with
substantial costs due to its compromises in their general functionality,
leading to a notorious trade-off between unlearning and retention. It motivates
this paper to explore enhanced unlearning schemes that can mitigate this
trade-off. Specifically, we propose Gradient Rectified Unlearning (GRU), an
improved framework that regulates the directions of gradient updates during the
unlearning procedure such that their side impacts on other, unrelated responses
can be minimized. GRU is easy and general to implement, demonstrating practical
effectiveness across a variety of well-established unlearning benchmarks.

*Qi Cao, Ruiyi Wang, Ruiyi Zhang, Sai Ashish Somayajula, Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DreamPRM is a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs, addressing dataset quality imbalance and improving generalization via bi-level optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending PRMs to MLLMs faces challenges like severe distribution shifts and dataset quality imbalance, necessitating a robust training framework.

Method: DreamPRM uses bi-level optimization: lower-level fine-tunes with domain weights, and upper-level updates weights via meta-learning feedback.

Result: DreamPRM improves MLLM performance on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, outperforming data selection and test-time scaling methods.

Conclusion: DreamPRM effectively addresses PRM challenges in MLLMs, enhancing reasoning performance through domain-reweighted training.

Abstract: Reasoning has improved the performance of large language models (LLMs) on
complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process Reward
Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning steps
and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning
covers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting
distribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to
greater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM,
therefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage.
However, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from quality imbalance,
which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for data selection
strategy. To address the issues, we introduce DreamPRM, a domain-reweighted
training framework for multimodal PRMs which employs bi-level optimization. In
the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM performs fine-tuning on multiple
datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM to prioritize high-quality
reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of dataset quality imbalance. In
the upper-level optimization, the PRM is evaluated on a separate meta-learning
dataset; this feedback updates the domain weights through an aggregation loss
function, thereby improving the generalization capability of trained PRM.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both
mathematical and general reasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM
consistently improves performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further
comparisons reveal that DreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses data
selection methods and yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time
scaling approaches. Codes are available at

*Ethan Harvey, Mikhail Petrov, Michael C. Hughes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a gradient-based method for learning regularization hyperparameters using a modified evidence lower bound (ELBo) to avoid overfitting in over-parameterized models, reducing grid search time significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Avoiding overfitting in large models trained on limited data is challenging, and traditional hyperparameter search methods are computationally expensive.

Method: The authors use a modified ELBo objective that emphasizes data likelihood over prior variance, applied to Bayesian transfer learning and Gaussian processes.

Result: The method reduces hyperparameter search time from 88+ hours to under 3 hours while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed data-emphasized ELBo is efficient and effective for hyperparameter learning in over-parameterized models.

Abstract: When training large flexible models on limited data, avoiding overfitting is
a practical concern. Common grid search or smarter search methods rely on
expensive separate runs at each candidate hyperparameter while carving out a
validation set that reduces available training data. In this paper, we consider
direct gradient-based learning of regularization hyperparameters on the full
training set via the evidence lower bound ("ELBo") objective from Bayesian
variational methods. We focus on scenarios where the model is
over-parameterized for flexibility while the approximate posterior is chosen to
be Gaussian with isotropic covariance for tractability, even though it cannot
match the true posterior exactly. In such scenarios, we find the ELBo
prioritizes posteriors that match the prior variance, which leads to severely
underfitting the data. Instead, we recommend a data-emphasized ELBo that
upweights the influence of the data likelihood relative to the prior. In
Bayesian transfer learning of classifiers for text and images, our method
reduces 88+ hour grid searches of past work to under 3 hours while delivering
comparable accuracy. We further demonstrate how our approach enables efficient
yet accurate approximations of Gaussian processes with learnable length-scale
kernels.

*Xinyi Wu, Yifei Wang, Stefanie Jegelka, Ali Jadbabaie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-theoretic framework to analyze position bias in transformers, revealing how attention masks and positional encodings shape biases, with causal masking favoring earlier positions and competing effects of positional encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive theoretical understanding of position bias in transformers, addressing gaps in knowledge about how attention masks and positional encodings influence these biases.

Method: A graph-theoretic approach models attention masks as directed graphs to quantify token interactions based on sequential positions, analyzing causal masking and positional encodings like RoPE.

Result: Causal masking biases attention toward earlier positions, while positional encodings introduce distance-based decay, leading to a trade-off between long-term decay and early position importance. Numerical experiments validate findings.

Conclusion: The framework offers a principled way to understand positional biases in transformers, aiding in better architectural design by clarifying the interplay of attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed various manifestations of position bias in
transformer architectures, from the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon to
attention sinks, yet a comprehensive theoretical understanding of how attention
masks and positional encodings shape these biases remains elusive. This paper
presents a graph-theoretic framework for analyzing position bias in multi-layer
attention. Modeling attention masks as directed graphs, we quantify how tokens
interact with contextual information based on their sequential positions. We
uncover two key insights: First, causal masking inherently biases attention
toward earlier positions, as tokens in deeper layers attend to increasingly
more contextualized representations of earlier tokens. Second, we characterize
the competing effects of the causal mask and relative positional encodings,
such as the decay mask and rotary positional encoding (RoPE): while both
mechanisms introduce distance-based decay within individual attention maps,
their aggregate effect across multiple attention layers$\unicode{x2013}$coupled
with the causal mask$\unicode{x2013}$leads to a trade-off between the long-term
decay effects and the cumulative importance of early sequence positions.
Through controlled numerical experiments, we not only validate our theoretical
findings but also reproduce position biases observed in real-world LLMs. Our
framework offers a principled foundation for understanding positional biases in
transformers, shedding light on the complex interplay of attention mechanism
components and guiding more informed architectural design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the weak-to-strong generalization challenge in LLMs by improving weak experts with limited human-level data.

Method: Token-level ensemble strategy iteratively combines weak experts to refine their supervision of stronger models.

Result: Achieves 4% and 3.2% improvements on ID datasets, and up to 6% and 2.28% on OOD datasets for experts and students.

Conclusion: EnsemW2S effectively advances weak-to-strong generalization, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly approaching and potentially
surpassing human-level performance, it has become imperative to develop
approaches capable of effectively supervising and enhancing these powerful
models using smaller, human-level models exposed to only human-level data. We
address this critical weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization challenge by
proposing a novel method aimed at improving weak experts, by training on the
same limited human-level data, enabling them to generalize to complex,
super-human-level tasks. Our approach, called \textbf{EnsemW2S}, employs a
token-level ensemble strategy that iteratively combines multiple weak experts,
systematically addressing the shortcomings identified in preceding iterations.
By continuously refining these weak models, we significantly enhance their
collective ability to supervise stronger student models. We extensively
evaluate the generalization performance of both the ensemble of weak experts
and the subsequent strong student model across in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. For OOD, we specifically introduce question
difficulty as an additional dimension for defining distributional shifts. Our
empirical results demonstrate notable improvements, achieving 4\%, and 3.2\%
improvements on ID datasets and, upto 6\% and 2.28\% on OOD datasets for
experts and student models respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of our
proposed method in advancing W2S generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world FL adoption in healthcare is limited by privacy, resource, and compliance challenges, with uniform DP noise degrading model performance.

Method: Proposes a compliance-aware FL framework with adaptive DP noise and a compliance scoring tool based on healthcare standards.

Result: Experiments show 15% accuracy improvement over traditional FL by integrating diverse clinical settings.

Conclusion: The framework balances privacy, compliance, and performance, making FL viable for global healthcare workflows.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for training clinical AI
models without centralizing sensitive patient data. However, its real-world
adoption is hindered by challenges related to privacy, resource constraints,
and compliance. Existing Differential Privacy (DP) approaches often apply
uniform noise, which disproportionately degrades model performance, even among
well-compliant institutions. In this work, we propose a novel compliance-aware
FL framework that enhances DP by adaptively adjusting noise based on
quantifiable client compliance scores. Additionally, we introduce a compliance
scoring tool based on key healthcare and security standards to promote secure,
inclusive, and equitable participation across diverse clinical settings.
Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that integrating
under-resourced, less compliant clinics with highly regulated institutions
yields accuracy improvements of up to 15% over traditional FL. This work
advances FL by balancing privacy, compliance, and performance, making it a
viable solution for real-world clinical workflows in global healthcare.

*Stefano Zampini, Jacob Christopher, Luca Oneto, Davide Anguita, Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating stable diffusion models with constrained optimization to enforce strict domain-specific constraints in generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for incorporating physics-based constraints into generative models are limited or lack strict enforcement capabilities.

Method: Novel integration of stable diffusion models with constrained optimization frameworks.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in material design, inverse design tasks, and copyright-constrained content generation.

Conclusion: The approach enables generation of outputs meeting stringent physical and functional requirements.

Abstract: Stable diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art in data synthesis
across diverse domains and hold transformative potential for applications in
science and engineering, e.g., by facilitating the discovery of novel solutions
and simulating systems that are computationally intractable to model
explicitly. While there is increasing effort to incorporate physics-based
constraints into generative models, existing techniques are either limited in
their applicability to latent diffusion frameworks or lack the capability to
strictly enforce domain-specific constraints. To address this limitation this
paper proposes a novel integration of stable diffusion models with constrained
optimization frameworks, enabling the generation of outputs satisfying
stringent physical and functional requirements. The effectiveness of this
approach is demonstrated through material design experiments requiring
adherence to precise morphometric properties, challenging inverse design tasks
involving the generation of materials inducing specific stress-strain
responses, and copyright-constrained content generation tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method called μnit Scaling (μS) enables efficient FP8 training for large language models without dynamic scaling or hyperparameter tuning, achieving quality parity with higher precision baselines and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8 training offers efficiency gains but faces challenges like reduced precision and the need for hyperparameter tuning or dynamic scaling.

Method: μnit Scaling (μS) provides a simple, scalable approach for FP8 training, requiring no dynamic scaling or special hyperparameters, and is based on minimal transformer operation interventions.

Result: Validated on models from 1B to 13B parameters, μS achieves equal quality to higher precision baselines and up to 33% faster training.

Conclusion: μS is a practical, efficient solution for FP8 training, enabling hyperparameter transfer and matched numerics across training and inference.

Abstract: Large Language Model training with 8-bit floating point (FP8) formats
promises significant efficiency improvements, but reduced numerical precision
makes training challenging. It is currently possible to train in FP8 only if
one is willing to tune various hyperparameters, reduce model scale, or accept
the overhead of computing dynamic scale factors. We demonstrate simple,
scalable FP8 training that requires no dynamic scaling factors or special
hyperparameters, even at large model sizes. Our method, $\mu$nit Scaling
($\mu$S), also enables simple hyperparameter transfer across model widths,
matched numerics across training and inference, and other desirable properties.
$\mu$nit Scaling is straightforward to implement, consisting of a set of
minimal interventions based on a first-principles analysis of common
transformer operations. We validate our method by training models from 1B to
13B parameters, performing all hidden linear layer computations in FP8. We
achieve quality equal to higher precision baselines while also training up to
33% faster.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-oblivious method to identify critical layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs using CKA, showing these layers align with fine-tuning impact and semantic transitions. Practical applications include efficient domain adaptation and backdoor defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpretability and robustness of LLMs by understanding feature representation evolution across layers without relying on fine-tuned data.

Method: Uses Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to analyze representation dynamics in pre-fine-tuned LLMs, identifying layers with significant shifts. Spectral analysis reveals semantic transitions in top principal components.

Result: Critical layers identified by CKA align with those most affected during fine-tuning, holding consistently across tasks. These layers drive semantic shifts from rationales to conclusions.

Conclusion: The findings enable practical applications like efficient domain adaptation (better loss reduction) and backdoor defense (reduced attack success by 40%).

Abstract: Understanding how feature representations evolve across layers in large
language models (LLMs) is key to improving their interpretability and
robustness. While recent studies have identified critical layers linked to
specific functions or behaviors, these efforts typically rely on data-dependent
analyses of fine-tuned models, limiting their use to post-hoc settings. In
contrast, we introduce a data-oblivious approach to identify intrinsic critical
layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs by analyzing representation dynamics via Centered
Kernel Alignment(CKA). We show that layers with significant shifts in
representation space are also those most affected during fine-tuning--a pattern
that holds consistently across tasks for a given model. Our spectral analysis
further reveals that these shifts are driven by changes in the top principal
components, which encode semantic transitions from rationales to conclusions.
We further apply these findings to two practical scenarios: efficient domain
adaptation, where fine-tuning critical layers leads to greater loss reduction
compared to non-critical layers; and backdoor defense, where freezing them
reduces attack success rates by up to 40%.

TL;DR: ADG uses diffusion models to clean corrupted offline RL datasets, improving robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling noise and errors in real-world datasets for offline RL is challenging, especially in high-dimensional spaces or with multiple corrupted elements.

Method: Proposes ADG: uses Ambient DDPM for partial corruption learning, identifies clean data, refines corrupted data with standard DDPM, and integrates with any offline RL algorithm.

Result: ADG effectively mitigates corruption impact, enhances offline RL robustness, and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit.

Conclusion: ADG is a versatile and effective solution for improving offline RL performance by addressing dataset corruption.

Abstract: Real-world datasets collected from sensors or human inputs are prone to noise
and errors, posing significant challenges for applying offline reinforcement
learning (RL). While existing methods have made progress in addressing
corrupted actions and rewards, they remain insufficient for handling corruption
in high-dimensional state spaces and for cases where multiple elements in the
dataset are corrupted simultaneously. Diffusion models, known for their strong
denoising capabilities, offer a promising direction for this problem-but their
tendency to overfit noisy samples limits their direct applicability. To
overcome this, we propose Ambient Diffusion-Guided Dataset Recovery (ADG), a
novel approach that pioneers the use of diffusion models to tackle data
corruption in offline RL. First, we introduce Ambient Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPM) from approximated distributions, which enable
learning on partially corrupted datasets with theoretical guarantees. Second,
we use the noise-prediction property of Ambient DDPM to distinguish between
clean and corrupted data, and then use the clean subset to train a standard
DDPM. Third, we employ the trained standard DDPM to refine the previously
identified corrupted data, enhancing data quality for subsequent offline RL
training. A notable strength of ADG is its versatility-it can be seamlessly
integrated with any offline RL algorithm. Experiments on a range of benchmarks,
including MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit, demonstrate that ADG effectively
mitigates the impact of corrupted data and improves the robustness of offline
RL under various noise settings, achieving state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of heterogeneity in large-scale decision-making problems, specifically weakly-coupled Markov decision processes (WCMDPs), and presents an asymptotically optimal policy for fully heterogeneous settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneity in large-scale decision-making problems, like WCMDPs, is understudied and poses significant challenges, especially as the number of arms (subproblems) grows.

Method: The authors propose an efficiently computable policy and use projection-based Lyapunov functions to analyze convergence under full heterogeneity.

Result: The policy achieves an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap in the long-run average reward per arm as $N$ becomes large, marking the first asymptotic optimality result for fully heterogeneous WCMDPs.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical foundation for handling fully heterogeneous WCMDPs, demonstrating asymptotic optimality and offering practical insights for large-scale decision-making.

Abstract: Heterogeneity poses a fundamental challenge for many real-world large-scale
decision-making problems but remains largely understudied. In this paper, we
study the fully heterogeneous setting of a prominent class of such problems,
known as weakly-coupled Markov decision processes (WCMDPs). Each WCMDP consists
of $N$ arms (or subproblems), which have distinct model parameters in the fully
heterogeneous setting, leading to the curse of dimensionality when $N$ is
large. We show that, under mild assumptions, an efficiently computable policy
achieves an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap in the long-run average reward per
arm for fully heterogeneous WCMDPs as $N$ becomes large. This is the first
asymptotic optimality result for fully heterogeneous average-reward WCMDPs. Our
main technical innovation is the construction of projection-based Lyapunov
functions that certify the convergence of rewards and costs to an optimal
region, even under full heterogeneity.

*Femi Bello, Anubrata Das, Fanzhi Zeng, Fangcong Yin, Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Linear Representation Transferability (LRT) Hypothesis, suggesting affine transformations can align representations across neural networks of different sizes, enabling small models to guide large ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if representations learned by models of varying scales can be aligned via linear transformations, enabling transfer of learned behaviors.

Method: Learn affine mappings between hidden states of models of different sizes and test if steering vectors retain semantic effects when transferred.

Result: Affine mappings preserve steering behaviors, supporting the LRT Hypothesis.

Conclusion: Small models' representations can guide large models, and the LRT Hypothesis offers a promising framework for understanding cross-scale representation alignment.

Abstract: It has been hypothesized that neural networks with similar architectures
trained on similar data learn shared representations relevant to the learning
task. We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where
representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed
as linear combinations of a \emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis
features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models,
regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \textbf{Linear
Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine
transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test
this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models
of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in
hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their
semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the
learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings
can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations
learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and
that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding
representation alignment across model scales.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReCalKV is a post-training KV cache compression method for LLMs, using distinct strategies for Keys and Values to reduce memory usage with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache compression is essential for efficient long-context reasoning in LLMs, but existing methods either add computation or degrade performance under high compression.

Method: ReCalKV uses Head-wise Similarity-aware Reordering (HSR) for Keys and Offline Calibration and Matrix Fusion (OCMF) for Values, optimizing compression without extra computation.

Result: ReCalKV outperforms existing methods, achieving high compression ratios with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: ReCalKV effectively addresses KV cache compression challenges, enabling efficient long-context reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance, yet their
capability on long-context reasoning is often constrained by the excessive
memory required to store the Key-Value (KV) cache. This makes KV cache
compression an essential step toward enabling efficient long-context reasoning.
Recent methods have explored reducing the hidden dimensions of the KV cache,
but many introduce additional computation through projection layers or suffer
from significant performance degradation under high compression ratios. To
address these challenges, we propose ReCalKV, a post-training KV cache
compression method that reduces the hidden dimensions of the KV cache. We
develop distinct compression strategies for Keys and Values based on their
different roles and varying importance in the attention mechanism. For Keys, we
propose Head-wise Similarity-aware Reordering (HSR), which clusters similar
heads and applies grouped SVD to the key projection matrix, reducing additional
computation while preserving accuracy. For Values, we propose Offline
Calibration and Matrix Fusion (OCMF) to preserve accuracy without extra
computational overhead. Experiments show that ReCalKV outperforms existing
low-rank compression methods, achieving high compression ratios with minimal
performance loss. The code and models will be available at:

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based
initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a
score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based
generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader
paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of
this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising
process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the
Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results
in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the
reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable
posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the
preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines
dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach
enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves
performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image
generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project Webpage:

TL;DR: SCAM-FQI proposes a scalable offline MARL method balancing dataset collection and policy learning, ensuring convergence and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between scalability and performance in offline MARL by leveraging structured information-sharing.

Method: Agents collect diverse datasets with an information-sharing network and learn localized policies without full observability or decentralization.

Result: Theoretical convergence to near-optimal policies and empirical validation on distributed decision-making.

Conclusion: SCAM-FQI effectively balances scalability and performance, supported by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on learning policies solely from
a batch of previously collected data. offering the potential to leverage such
datasets effectively without the need for costly or risky active exploration.
While recent advances in Offline Multi-Agent RL (MARL) have shown promise, most
existing methods either rely on large datasets jointly collected by all agents
or agent-specific datasets collected independently. The former approach ensures
strong performance but raises scalability concerns, while the latter emphasizes
scalability at the expense of performance guarantees. In this work, we propose
a novel scalable routine for both dataset collection and offline learning.
Agents first collect diverse datasets coherently with a pre-specified
information-sharing network and subsequently learn coherent localized policies
without requiring either full observability or falling back to complete
decentralization. We theoretically demonstrate that this structured approach
allows a multi-agent extension of the seminal Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI)
algorithm to globally converge, in high probability, to near-optimal policies.
The convergence is subject to error terms that depend on the informativeness of
the shared information. Furthermore, we show how this approach allows to bound
the inherent error of the supervised-learning phase of FQI with the mutual
information between shared and unshared information. Our algorithm, SCAlable
Multi-agent FQI (SCAM-FQI), is then evaluated on a distributed decision-making

### [613] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation as Noisy In-Context Learning: A Unified Theory and Risk Bounds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03100)
*Yang Guo, Yutian Tao, Yifei Ming, Robert D. Nowak, Yingyu Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides the first theoretical analysis of Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG), deriving a finite-sample generalization bound and bias-variance tradeoff for in-context linear regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite empirical successes of RAG, its theoretical foundations remain unexplored. This work aims to bridge that gap.

Method: The framework treats retrieved texts as query-dependent noisy in-context examples, unifying classical in-context learning (ICL) and RAG. It introduces uniform and non-uniform RAG noise to model retrieval from training data and external corpora.

Result: The analysis reveals an intrinsic ceiling on RAG's generalization error, unlike ICL. Empirical experiments on QA benchmarks (Natural Questions, TriviaQA) validate the theory, showing sample efficiency for ICL and RAG.

Conclusion: The paper establishes theoretical foundations for RAG, highlighting its limitations and advantages over ICL, supported by empirical evidence.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has seen many empirical successes in
recent years by aiding the LLM with external knowledge. However, its
theoretical aspect has remained mostly unexplored. In this paper, we propose
the first finite-sample generalization bound for RAG in in-context linear
regression and derive an exact bias-variance tradeoff. Our framework views the
retrieved texts as query-dependent noisy in-context examples and recovers the
classical in-context learning (ICL) and standard RAG as the limit cases. Our
analysis suggests that an intrinsic ceiling on generalization error exists on
RAG as opposed to the ICL. Furthermore, our framework is able to model
retrieval both from the training data and from external corpora by introducing
uniform and non-uniform RAG noise. In line with our theory, we show the sample
efficiency of ICL and RAG empirically with experiments on common QA benchmarks,
such as Natural Questions and TriviaQA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel training objective, HierarchicalTopK, enables a single Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to handle multiple sparsity levels, improving flexibility and efficiency without sacrificing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SAEs require separate models for different sparsity levels, increasing computational costs. HierarchicalTopK addresses this limitation by training one model for multiple sparsity needs.

Method: Introduces HierarchicalTopK, a training objective that optimizes reconstructions across various sparsity levels simultaneously.

Result: Achieves Pareto-optimal trade-offs between sparsity and explained variance, outperforming traditional SAEs. Maintains high interpretability even at higher sparsity.

Conclusion: HierarchicalTopK bridges the gap between flexibility and interpretability in SAE design, offering computational efficiency and performance gains.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven to be powerful tools for interpreting
neural networks by decomposing hidden representations into disentangled,
interpretable features via sparsity constraints. However, conventional SAEs are
constrained by the fixed sparsity level chosen during training; meeting
different sparsity requirements therefore demands separate models and increases
the computational footprint during both training and evaluation. We introduce a
novel training objective, \emph{HierarchicalTopK}, which trains a single SAE to
optimise reconstructions across multiple sparsity levels simultaneously.
Experiments with Gemma-2 2B demonstrate that our approach achieves
Pareto-optimal trade-offs between sparsity and explained variance,
outperforming traditional SAEs trained at individual sparsity levels. Further
analysis shows that HierarchicalTopK preserves high interpretability scores
even at higher sparsity. The proposed objective thus closes an important gap
between flexibility and interpretability in SAE design.

*Aojun Lu, Hangjie Yuan, Tao Feng, Yanan Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual-Arch, a framework for Continual Learning (CL) that balances stability and plasticity at the architectural level by using two specialized networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the stability-plasticity dilemma in CL by exploring architectural impacts, not just parameter-level trade-offs.

Method: Proposes Dual-Arch, a plug-in framework with two independent networks: one for plasticity (deeper) and one for stability (wider).

Result: Dual-Arch improves CL performance and reduces parameter size by up to 87%.

Conclusion: Architectural-level solutions like Dual-Arch effectively address the stability-plasticity dilemma in CL.

Abstract: The quest for Continual Learning (CL) seeks to empower neural networks with
the ability to learn and adapt incrementally. Central to this pursuit is
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma, which involves striking a balance
between two conflicting objectives: preserving previously learned knowledge and
acquiring new knowledge. While numerous CL methods aim to achieve this
trade-off, they often overlook the impact of network architecture on stability
and plasticity, restricting the trade-off to the parameter level. In this
paper, we delve into the conflict between stability and plasticity at the
architectural level. We reveal that under an equal parameter constraint, deeper
networks exhibit better plasticity, while wider networks are characterized by
superior stability. To address this architectural-level dilemma, we introduce a
novel framework denoted Dual-Arch, which serves as a plug-in component for CL.
This framework leverages the complementary strengths of two distinct and
independent networks: one dedicated to plasticity and the other to stability.
Each network is designed with a specialized and lightweight architecture,
tailored to its respective objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Dual-Arch enhances the performance of existing CL methods while being up to 87%
more compact in terms of parameters. Code:

*Hans Hao-Hsun Hsu, Shikun Liu, Han Zhao, Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSA is a novel algorithm for Graph Test-Time Adaptation (GTTA) that aligns graph structures during inference without needing source data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based learning struggles with performance under distribution shifts, especially in network connectivity, and current solutions require impractical retraining with source data.

Method: TSA uses uncertainty-aware neighborhood weighting, adaptive balancing of node and neighborhood representations, and decision boundary refinement to handle shifts.

Result: TSA consistently outperforms non-graph TTA methods and GTTA baselines in experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TSA effectively addresses graph data distribution shifts during inference, offering a practical solution without source data access.

Abstract: Graph-based learning excels at capturing interaction patterns in diverse
domains like recommendation, fraud detection, and particle physics. However,
its performance often degrades under distribution shifts, especially those
altering network connectivity. Current methods to address these shifts
typically require retraining with the source dataset, which is often infeasible
due to computational or privacy limitations. We introduce Test-Time Structural
Alignment (TSA), a novel algorithm for Graph Test-Time Adaptation (GTTA) that
aligns graph structures during inference without accessing the source data.
Grounded in a theoretical understanding of graph data distribution shifts, TSA
employs three synergistic strategies: uncertainty-aware neighborhood weighting
to accommodate neighbor label distribution shifts, adaptive balancing of
self-node and aggregated neighborhood representations based on their
signal-to-noise ratio, and decision boundary refinement to correct residual
label and feature shifts. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate TSA's consistent outperformance of both non-graph TTA
methods and state-of-the-art GTTA baselines.

*Aojun Lu, Tao Feng, Hangjie Yuan, Chunhui Ding, Yanan Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACL enhances continual learning by refining pre-trained models before each task, balancing stability and plasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the stability-plasticity trade-off in continual learning with pre-trained models.

Method: Propose ACL, a framework adapting PTMs before each task, using techniques like prompt tuning.

Result: ACL improves performance across benchmarks, balancing stability and plasticity.

Conclusion: ACL offers a versatile solution for PTM-based continual learning.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to enable neural networks to incrementally
acquire new knowledge (plasticity) while retaining existing knowledge
(stability). While pre-trained models (PTMs) have become pivotal in CL,
prevailing approaches freeze the PTM backbone to preserve stability, limiting
their plasticity, particularly when encountering significant domain gaps in
incremental tasks. Conversely, sequentially finetuning the entire PTM risks
catastrophic forgetting of generalizable knowledge, exposing a critical
stability-plasticity trade-off. To address this challenge, we propose Adapting
PTMs before the core CL process (ACL), a novel framework that refines the PTM
backbone through a plug-and-play adaptation phase before learning each new task
with existing CL approaches (e.g., prompt tuning). ACL enhances plasticity by
aligning embeddings with their original class prototypes while distancing them
from others, theoretically and empirically shown to balance stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACL significantly improves
CL performance across benchmarks and integrated methods, offering a versatile
solution for PTM-based CL. Code is available at

### [618] [Adversarial Combinatorial Semi-bandits with Graph Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18826)
*Yuxiao Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends combinatorial semi-bandits to include graph feedback, showing optimal regret scales with the size of decisions and graph independence number. It bridges full information and semi-bandit feedback regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize combinatorial semi-bandits by incorporating graph feedback, capturing intermediate cases between full information and semi-bandit feedback.

Method: Extends the framework to graph feedback, analyzes regret scaling, and uses convexified actions with negative correlations.

Result: Optimal regret is shown to scale as Θ̃(S√T + √(αST)), interpolating between full information and semi-bandit feedback.

Conclusion: Graph feedback provides a flexible model, and OSMD with convexified actions is suboptimal for this setting.

Abstract: In combinatorial semi-bandits, a learner repeatedly selects from a
combinatorial decision set of arms, receives the realized sum of rewards, and
observes the rewards of the individual selected arms as feedback. In this
paper, we extend this framework to include \emph{graph feedback}, where the
learner observes the rewards of all neighboring arms of the selected arms in a
feedback graph $G$. We establish that the optimal regret over a time horizon
$T$ scales as $\widetilde{\Theta}(S\sqrt{T}+\sqrt{\alpha ST})$, where $S$ is
the size of the combinatorial decisions and $\alpha$ is the independence number
of $G$. This result interpolates between the known regrets
$\widetilde\Theta(S\sqrt{T})$ under full information (i.e., $G$ is complete)
and $\widetilde\Theta(\sqrt{KST})$ under the semi-bandit feedback (i.e., $G$
has only self-loops), where $K$ is the total number of arms. A key technical
ingredient is to realize a convexified action using a random decision vector
with negative correlations. We also show that online stochastic mirror descent
(OSMD) that only realizes convexified actions in expectation is suboptimal.

*Seungwook Han, Jyothish Pari, Samuel J. Gershman, Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs show utility but struggle with adaptive reasoning and generalization. Proposed solution: decouple knowledge and reasoning via RL pretraining, synthetic task curriculum, and generalizable reasoning functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack robust reasoning and generalization, hindering progress toward AGI.

Method: Disentangle knowledge and reasoning through RL pretraining, synthetic task curriculum, and limited context windows.

Result: Improved reasoning transferability and generalization in novel scenarios.

Conclusion: Decoupling knowledge and reasoning can bridge the gap between AUI and AGI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive real-world utility,
exemplifying artificial useful intelligence (AUI). However, their ability to
reason adaptively and robustly -- the hallmarks of artificial general
intelligence (AGI) -- remains fragile. While LLMs seemingly succeed in
commonsense reasoning, programming, and mathematics, they struggle to
generalize algorithmic understanding across novel contexts. Our experiments
with algorithmic tasks in esoteric programming languages reveal that LLM's
reasoning overfits to the training data and is limited in its transferability.
We hypothesize that the core issue underlying such limited transferability is
the coupling of reasoning and knowledge in LLMs.
  To transition from AUI to AGI, we propose disentangling knowledge and
reasoning through three key directions: (1) pretaining to reason using RL from
scratch as an alternative to the widely used next-token prediction pretraining,
(2) using a curriculum of synthetic tasks to ease the learning of a reasoning
prior for RL that can then be transferred to natural language tasks, and (3)
learning more generalizable reasoning functions using a small context window to
reduce exploiting spurious correlations between tokens. Such a reasoning system
coupled with a trained retrieval system and a large external memory bank as a
knowledge store can overcome several limitations of existing architectures at
learning to reason in novel scenarios.

### [620] [On the Power of Context-Enhanced Learning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01821)
*Xingyu Zhu, Abhishek Panigrahi, Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Context-enhanced learning for LLMs improves sample efficiency by enhancing context with additional data, without computing auto-regressive gradients. It outperforms standard learning in multi-step reasoning tasks and offers better gradient signals. However, detecting or recovering context data used during training is difficult, raising data security and copyright concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a gradient-based analog of in-context learning (ICL) for LLMs, aiming to improve sample efficiency and learning accuracy by leveraging enhanced context.

Method: Formalizes context-enhanced learning, where standard gradient-based learning is applied to text with additional context data (no auto-regressive gradients). Analyzed using a multi-step reasoning task in a simplified setting.

Result: Proves context-enhanced learning is exponentially more sample-efficient than standard learning when the model supports ICL. Mechanistically, it provides a more accurate gradient signal. Experimentally, context data used in training is hard to detect or recover.

Conclusion: Context-enhanced learning offers significant efficiency and accuracy benefits but poses challenges for data security and copyright due to the difficulty of tracing context data usage.

Abstract: We formalize a new concept for LLMs, context-enhanced learning. It involves
standard gradient-based learning on text except that the context is enhanced
with additional data on which no auto-regressive gradients are computed. This
setting is a gradient-based analog of usual in-context learning (ICL) and
appears in some recent works. Using a multi-step reasoning task, we prove in a
simplified setting that context-enhanced learning can be exponentially more
sample-efficient than standard learning when the model is capable of ICL. At a
mechanistic level, we find that the benefit of context-enhancement arises from
a more accurate gradient learning signal. We also experimentally demonstrate
that it appears hard to detect or recover learning materials that were used in
the context during training. This may have implications for data security as
well as copyright.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PoisonedParrot is a stealthy data poisoning attack that makes LLMs generate copyrighted content without direct training on it. Existing defenses fail against it, and a new defense, ParrotTrap, is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing copyright infringement in LLM-generated content is challenging, as lawsuits highlight. PoisonedParrot explores this issue by inducing copyright violations indirectly.

Method: PoisonedParrot integrates small copyrighted text fragments into poison samples using an off-the-shelf LLM, priming the model to generate copyrighted content.

Result: The attack is highly effective with no side effects, and existing defenses fail against it.

Conclusion: The paper proposes ParrotTrap as a defense and urges further exploration of this threat model.

Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, their
usage has become increasingly prevalent. However, as reflected in numerous
ongoing lawsuits regarding LLM-generated content, addressing copyright
infringement remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce
PoisonedParrot: the first stealthy data poisoning attack that induces an LLM to
generate copyrighted content even when the model has not been directly trained
on the specific copyrighted material. PoisonedParrot integrates small fragments
of copyrighted text into the poison samples using an off-the-shelf LLM. Despite
its simplicity, evaluated in a wide range of experiments, PoisonedParrot is
surprisingly effective at priming the model to generate copyrighted content
with no discernible side effects. Moreover, we discover that existing defenses
are largely ineffective against our attack. Finally, we make the first attempt
at mitigating copyright-infringement poisoning attacks by proposing a defense:
ParrotTrap. We encourage the community to explore this emerging threat model
further.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AIKAE, an augmented version of invertible Koopman autoencoders, to address dimensionality limitations in IKAE models by adding a non-invertible encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing invertible Koopman autoencoders (IKAEs) are limited by dimension conservation from normalizing flows, prompting the need for an improved model.

Method: Proposes AIKAE, combining an invertible encoder (normalizing flow) with a non-invertible encoder to augment the latent state.

Result: AIKAE shows improved performance in long-term time series forecasting tasks, including satellite image time series and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: AIKAE effectively overcomes the limitations of IKAE models, demonstrating its utility in dynamical system modeling and forecasting.

Abstract: Following the introduction of Dynamic Mode Decomposition and its numerous
extensions, many neural autoencoder-based implementations of the Koopman
operator have recently been proposed. This class of methods appears to be of
interest for modeling dynamical systems, either through direct long-term
prediction of the evolution of the state or as a powerful embedding for
downstream methods. In particular, a recent line of work has developed
invertible Koopman autoencoders (IKAEs), which provide an exact reconstruction
of the input state thanks to their analytically invertible encoder, based on
coupling layer normalizing flow models. We identify that the conservation of
the dimension imposed by the normalizing flows is a limitation for the IKAE
models, and thus we propose to augment the latent state with a second,
non-invertible encoder network. This results in our new model: the Augmented
Invertible Koopman AutoEncoder (AIKAE). We demonstrate the relevance of the
AIKAE through a series of long-term time series forecasting experiments, on
satellite image time series as well as on a benchmark involving predictions
based on a large lookback window of observations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Incremental Data Selection (IDS) problem, proposing PEAKS, a method that outperforms existing strategies by considering geometric relationships and prediction errors in dynamic data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding which data examples are most important for generalization in dynamic contexts, as deep learning relies on increasingly large datasets.

Method: Proposes PEAKS (Prediction Error Anchored by Kernel Similarity), which incrementally selects data based on feature space geometry and prediction error.

Result: PEAKS consistently outperforms existing selection strategies, with better performance returns as training data size grows.

Conclusion: PEAKS is an efficient solution for IDS, demonstrating superior performance in real-world datasets.

Abstract: As deep learning continues to be driven by ever-larger datasets,
understanding which examples are most important for generalization has become a
critical question. While progress in data selection continues, emerging
applications require studying this problem in dynamic contexts. To bridge this
gap, we pose the Incremental Data Selection (IDS) problem, where examples
arrive as a continuous stream, and need to be selected without access to the
full data source. In this setting, the learner must incrementally build a
training dataset of predefined size while simultaneously learning the
underlying task. We find that in IDS, the impact of a new sample on the model
state depends fundamentally on both its geometric relationship in the feature
space and its prediction error. Leveraging this insight, we propose PEAKS
(Prediction Error Anchored by Kernel Similarity), an efficient data selection
method tailored for IDS. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PEAKS
consistently outperforms existing selection strategies. Furthermore, PEAKS
yields increasingly better performance returns than random selection as
training data size grows on real-world datasets. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoGNNs-LLMEA integrates a graph neural network with task-adaptive message passing and a large language model-enhanced evolutionary algorithm to improve HLS design space exploration, achieving state-of-the-art prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HLS prediction models prioritize structural complexity and training loss, overlooking task-specific characteristics, while evolutionary algorithms in DSE require extensive domain knowledge.

Method: Proposes CoGNNs, leveraging intermediate compiler representations for QoR prediction without HLS tools, and LLMEA for evolutionary optimization.

Result: CoGNNs reduces mean prediction errors by 2.8× for latency and 3.4× for resource utilization compared to baselines.

Conclusion: CoGNNs-LLMEA effectively bridges high-level abstractions and physical implementation, offering superior accuracy and adaptability in HLS DSE.

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) design space exploration (DSE) is an optimization
process in electronic design automation (EDA) that systematically explores
high-level design configurations to achieve Pareto-optimal hardware
implementations balancing performance, area, and power (PPA). To optimize this
process, HLS prediction tasks often employ message-passing neural networks
(MPNNs), leveraging complex architectures to achieve high accuracy. These
predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the
time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However,
existing models often prioritize structural complexity and minimization of
training loss, overlooking task-specific characteristics. Additionally, while
evolutionary algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require
extensive domain-specific knowledge to design effective crossover and mutation
operators. To address these limitations, we propose CoGNNs-LLMEA, a framework
that integrates a graph neural network with task-adaptive message passing and a
large language model-enhanced evolutionary algorithm. As a predictive model,
CoGNNs directly leverages intermediate representations generated from source
code after compiler front-end processing, enabling prediction of quality of
results (QoR) without invoking HLS tools. Due to its strong adaptability to
tasks, CoGNNs can be tuned to predict post-HLS and post-implementation
outcomes, effectively bridging the gap between high-level abstractions and
physical implementation characteristics. CoGNNs achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy in post-HLS QoR prediction, reducing mean prediction errors
by 2.8$\times$ for latency and 3.4$\times$ for resource utilization compared to
baseline models.

Result: Achieves $\tilde{O}(T^{0.25(1-\alpha)})$-GDP and $O(K\ln^{\alpha+1}(T)/\Delta)$ regret, where $\alpha$ controls the trade-off.

Conclusion: DP-TS-UCB provides a flexible privacy-regret trade-off, with theoretical insights into exploration mechanisms in bandit algorithms.

Abstract: We address differentially private stochastic bandit problems from the angles
of exploring the deep connections among Thompson Sampling with Gaussian priors,
Gaussian mechanisms, and Gaussian differential privacy (GDP). We propose
DP-TS-UCB, a novel parametrized private bandit algorithm that enables to trade
off privacy and regret. DP-TS-UCB satisfies $ \tilde{O}

controls the trade-off between privacy and regret. Theoretically, our DP-TS-UCB
relies on anti-concentration bounds of Gaussian distributions and links
exploration mechanisms in Thompson Sampling-based algorithms and Upper
Confidence Bound-based algorithms, which may be of independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCL methods overlook biologically relevant perturbations like gene knockdowns in biological networks such as GRNs.

Method: SupGCL extends GCL by incorporating biological perturbations from gene knockdown experiments as supervision, creating probabilistic models.

Result: SupGCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in tasks like patient hazard prediction, disease subtype classification, and gene function classification.

Conclusion: SupGCL effectively integrates biological perturbations, enhancing representation learning for GRNs and improving downstream task performance.

Abstract: Graph representation learning is effective for obtaining a meaningful latent
space utilizing the structure of graph data and is widely applied, including
biological networks. In particular, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has
emerged as a powerful self-supervised method that relies on applying
perturbations to graphs for data augmentation. However, when applying existing
GCL methods to biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs),
they overlooked meaningful biologically relevant perturbations, e.g., gene
knockdowns. In this study, we introduce SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive
Learning), a novel GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological
perturbations derived from gene knockdown experiments as the supervision.
SupGCL mathematically extends existing GCL methods that utilize non-biological
perturbations to probabilistic models that introduce actual biological gene
perturbation utilizing gene knockdown data. Using the GRN representation
obtained by our proposed method, our aim is to improve the performance of
biological downstream tasks such as patient hazard prediction and disease
subtype classification (graph-level task), and gene function classification
(node-level task). We applied SupGCL on real GRN datasets derived from patients
with multiple types of cancer, and in all experiments SupGCL achieves better
performance than state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation (SESaMo), a technique to incorporate symmetries into normalizing flows, enhancing model flexibility for learning exact and broken symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling from unnormalized Boltzmann-like distributions is a challenge in fields like physics and chemistry. Incorporating symmetries into deep generative models can improve performance.

Method: SESaMo uses stochastic modulation to integrate inductive biases (e.g., symmetries) into normalizing flows, building on equivariant normalizing flows.

Result: Numerical experiments on an 8-Gaussian mixture model and field theories (e.g., $\phi^4$ theory, Hubbard model) demonstrate SESaMo's effectiveness.

Conclusion: SESaMo advances symmetry-equivariant generative models, offering a flexible approach for learning complex symmetries in diverse applications.

Abstract: Deep generative models have recently garnered significant attention across
various fields, from physics to chemistry, where sampling from unnormalized
Boltzmann-like distributions represents a fundamental challenge. In particular,
autoregressive models and normalizing flows have become prominent due to their
appealing ability to yield closed-form probability densities. Moreover, it is
well-established that incorporating prior knowledge - such as symmetries - into
deep neural networks can substantially improve training performances. In this
context, recent advances have focused on developing symmetry-equivariant
generative models, achieving remarkable results. Building upon these
foundations, this paper introduces Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation
(SESaMo). Similar to equivariant normalizing flows, SESaMo enables the
incorporation of inductive biases (e.g., symmetries) into normalizing flows
through a novel technique called stochastic modulation. This approach enhances
the flexibility of the generative model, allowing to effectively learn a
variety of exact and broken symmetries. Our numerical experiments benchmark
SESaMo in different scenarios, including an 8-Gaussian mixture model and
physically relevant field theories, such as the $\phi^4$ theory and the Hubbard

Motivation: The need for accurate and interpretable propagation modeling in next-gen wireless systems (5G and beyond) drives this research, as traditional methods lack these qualities.

Method: Two AI-based techniques are introduced: Deep Symbolic Regression (interpretable) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (two-level interpretability), evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks achieve high accuracy (R^2 ≈ 1), while Deep Symbolic Regression yields compact models. Automated methods reduce prediction errors by up to 75%.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer efficient, accurate, and interpretable solutions for next-gen path loss models, surpassing traditional approaches.

Abstract: Modeling propagation is the cornerstone for designing and optimizing
next-generation wireless systems, with a particular emphasis on 5G and beyond
era. Traditional modeling methods have long relied on statistic-based
techniques to characterize propagation behavior across different environments.
With the expansion of wireless communication systems, there is a growing demand
for methods that guarantee the accuracy and interpretability of modeling.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, in particular, are increasingly
being adopted to overcome this challenge, although the interpretability is not
assured with most of these methods. Inspired by recent advancements in AI, this
paper proposes a novel approach that accelerates the discovery of path loss
models while maintaining interpretability. The proposed method automates the
formulation, evaluation, and refinement of the model, facilitating the
discovery of the model. We examine two techniques: one based on Deep Symbolic
Regression, offering full interpretability, and the second based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, providing two levels of interpretability. Both
approaches are evaluated on two synthetic and two real-world datasets. Our
results show that Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks achieve the coefficient of
determination value R^2 close to 1 with minimal prediction error, while Deep
Symbolic Regression generates compact models with moderate accuracy. Moreover,
on the selected examples, we demonstrate that automated methods outperform
traditional methods, achieving up to 75% reduction in prediction errors,
offering accurate and explainable solutions with potential to increase the
efficiency of discovering next-generation path loss models.

*Fuyuan Lyu, Linfeng Du, Yunpeng Weng, Qiufang Ying, Zhiyan Xu, Wen Zou, Haolun Wu, Xiuqiang He, Xing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RTS-PnO, a risk-aware framework for fund allocation that addresses goal mismatch and forecasting uncertainty, outperforming baselines in offline and online experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fund allocation in finance faces challenges like goal mismatch and uncertainty in predictions, which naive or Predict-then-Optimize methods fail to address.

Method: The RTS-PnO framework features end-to-end training, adaptive uncertainty calibration, and model agnosticism, evaluated on diverse financial datasets.

Result: RTS-PnO outperforms baselines in offline experiments (8 datasets) and reduces regret by 8.4% in an online payment business test.

Conclusion: RTS-PnO effectively addresses fund allocation challenges, demonstrating superior performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Fund allocation has been an increasingly important problem in the financial
domain. In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a
certain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or
Predict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the
introduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces
additional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems
mentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate
(RTS-PnO) framework, which holds no prior assumption on the forecasting models.
Such a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with
objective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty
calibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models. The evaluation of
RTS-PnO is conducted over both online and offline experiments. For offline
experiments, eight datasets from three categories of financial applications are
used: Currency, Stock, and Cryptos. RTS-PnO consistently outperforms other
competitive baselines. The online experiment is conducted on the Cross-Border
Payment business at FiT, Tencent, and an 8.4\% decrease in regret is witnessed
when compared with the product-line approach. The code for the offline
experiment is available at https://github.com/fuyuanlyu/RTS-PnO.

*Ni Mu, Hao Hu, Xiao Hu, Yiqin Yang, Bo Xu, Qing-Shan Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLARIFY improves PbRL by addressing ambiguous human feedback through contrastive learning, enhancing query selection and embedding quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human struggles with labeling preferences for similar segments reduce PbRL's efficiency and practicality.

Method: Proposes CLARIFY, an offline PbRL method using contrastive learning to create a trajectory embedding space that clarifies ambiguous feedback.

Result: Outperforms baselines in non-ideal and real human feedback settings, selecting clearer queries and learning meaningful embeddings.

Conclusion: CLARIFY enhances PbRL by resolving ambiguity in human feedback, improving both query selection and embedding learning.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses explicit reward
engineering by inferring reward functions from human preference comparisons,
enabling better alignment with human intentions. However, humans often struggle
to label a clear preference between similar segments, reducing label efficiency
and limiting PbRL's real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an
offline PbRL method: Contrastive LeArning for ResolvIng Ambiguous Feedback
(CLARIFY), which learns a trajectory embedding space that incorporates
preference information, ensuring clearly distinguished segments are spaced
apart, thus facilitating the selection of more unambiguous queries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CLARIFY outperforms baselines in both non-ideal
teachers and real human feedback settings. Our approach not only selects more
distinguished queries but also learns meaningful trajectory embeddings.

TL;DR: OpenThoughts project creates open-source datasets for training reasoning models, achieving state-of-the-art results with OpenThoughts3-7B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of public datasets for training reasoning models by creating open-source alternatives.

Method: Developed datasets (OpenThoughts2-1M, OpenThoughts3) and models (OpenThinker2-32B, OpenThoughts3-7B) through systematic experiments and scaling.

Result: OpenThoughts3-7B achieved 53% on AIME 2025, 51% on LiveCodeBench, and 54% on GPQA Diamond, outperforming DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B.

Conclusion: Open-source datasets and models can match or exceed proprietary solutions in reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Reasoning models have made rapid progress on many benchmarks involving math,
code, and science. Yet, there are still many open questions about the best
training recipes for reasoning since state-of-the-art models often rely on
proprietary datasets with little to no public information available. To address
this, the goal of the OpenThoughts project is to create open-source datasets
for training reasoning models. After initial explorations, our OpenThoughts2-1M
dataset led to OpenThinker2-32B, the first model trained on public reasoning
data to match DeepSeek-R1-Distill-32B on standard reasoning benchmarks such as
AIME and LiveCodeBench. We then improve our dataset further by systematically
investigating each step of our data generation pipeline with 1,000+ controlled
experiments, which led to OpenThoughts3. Scaling the pipeline to 1.2M examples
and using QwQ-32B as teacher yields our OpenThoughts3-7B model, which achieves
state-of-the-art results: 53% on AIME 2025, 51% on LiveCodeBench 06/24-01/25,
and 54% on GPQA Diamond - improvements of 15.3, 17.2, and 20.5 percentage
points compared to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B. All of our datasets and
models are available on https://openthoughts.ai.

*Botao Amber Hu, Helena Rong*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores whether open, decentralized AI systems like Spore.fun can achieve Open-Ended Evolution (OEE) by interacting with real-world environments, unlike traditional closed ALife simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ALife simulations plateau in novelty, suggesting OEE requires open systems. The rise of decentralized AI agents (e.g., Spore.fun) offers a new paradigm for testing this hypothesis.

Method: Case study of Spore.fun, analyzing autonomous AI agents' behaviors and evolution via digital ethology, leveraging blockchain and TEEs.

Result: Presents insights into agent behaviors and evolutionary trajectories, suggesting potential for sustained novelty in open systems.

Conclusion: Open ALife systems, driven by economic incentives and real-world interaction, may finally achieve OEE, sparking further debate.

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

TL;DR: HASHIRU is a hierarchical MAS framework improving flexibility, resource efficiency, and adaptability with dynamic agent management, hybrid intelligence, and autonomous tool creation, outperforming benchmarks like Gemini 2.0 Flash.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAS frameworks lack flexibility, resource awareness, model diversity, and autonomous tool creation, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: HASHIRU uses a 'CEO' agent to manage specialized 'employee' agents dynamically, leveraging hybrid intelligence (local and external LLMs), an economic model for resource allocation, and autonomous API tool creation.

Result: HASHIRU achieves high success rates in tasks like academic paper review (58%), safety assessments (100%), and complex reasoning (outperforming Gemini 2.0 Flash).

Conclusion: HASHIRU provides a robust, efficient, and adaptable MAS solution through hierarchical control, hybrid intelligence, and autonomous extensions, with open-source availability.

Abstract: Rapid Large Language Model (LLM) advancements are fueling autonomous
Multi-Agent System (MAS) development. However, current frameworks often lack
flexibility, resource awareness, model diversity, and autonomous tool creation.
This paper introduces HASHIRU (Hierarchical Agent System for Hybrid Intelligent
Resource Utilization), a novel MAS framework enhancing flexibility, resource
efficiency, and adaptability. HASHIRU features a "CEO" agent dynamically
managing specialized "employee" agents, instantiated based on task needs and
resource constraints (cost, memory). Its hybrid intelligence prioritizes
smaller, local LLMs (via Ollama) while flexibly using external APIs and larger
models when necessary. An economic model with hiring/firing costs promotes team
stability and efficient resource allocation. The system also includes
autonomous API tool creation and a memory function. Evaluations on tasks like
academic paper review (58% success), safety assessments (100% on a
JailbreakBench subset), and complex reasoning (outperforming Gemini 2.0 Flash
on GSM8K: 96% vs. 61%; JEEBench: 80% vs. 68.3%; SVAMP: 92% vs. 84%) demonstrate
HASHIRU's capabilities. Case studies illustrate its self-improvement via
autonomous cost model generation, tool integration, and budget management.
HASHIRU offers a promising approach for more robust, efficient, and adaptable
MAS through dynamic hierarchical control, resource-aware hybrid intelligence,
and autonomous functional extension. Source code and benchmarks are available

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper addresses credit assignment in MARL by proposing CORA, a coalition-level method that outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARL methods fail to account for distinct agent contributions at the coalition level, leading to suboptimal policies.

Method: Proposes CORA, which evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions and uses cooperative game theory's core solution for decomposition.

Result: CORA outperforms baselines in matrix games, differential games, and collaboration benchmarks, especially in tasks with local optima.

Conclusion: Coalition-aware credit assignment, as in CORA, is crucial for improving MARL performance.

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

TL;DR: HoAs-PALN, a heterogeneous multi-agent scheduling algorithm, improves post-disaster environmental data collection by reducing decision time and optimizing collaboration among UAVs, workers, and vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like weak adaptability and limited practicality in post-disaster sensing, the paper aims to enhance rescue operations through efficient data collection.

Method: HoAs-PALN uses adaptive dimensionality reduction in matching and a local Nash equilibrium game to optimize scheduling among agents.

Result: HoAs-PALN outperforms baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL, MARL) with task completion rate improvements of up to 64.12% and decision times under 10 seconds.

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN is effective for dynamic post-disaster environments, offering significant improvements in efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

Motivation: To address the fragmented landscape of CAIS by providing a unified framework for analysis, taxonomy, and evaluation, aiding researchers and practitioners.

Method: Defines CAIS, proposes a multi-dimensional taxonomy, analyzes four paradigms (RAG, LLM Agents, MLLMs, orchestration), reviews systems, and compares design trade-offs.

Result: Identifies key challenges like scalability, interoperability, benchmarking, and coordination, and outlines future research directions.

Conclusion: The survey offers a foundation for advancing system-level AI, helping researchers and practitioners understand and develop next-gen CAIS.

Abstract: Compound Al Systems (CAIS) is an emerging paradigm that integrates large
language models (LLMs) with external components, such as retrievers, agents,
tools, and orchestrators, to overcome the limitations of standalone models in
tasks requiring memory, reasoning, real-time grounding, and multimodal
understanding. These systems enable more capable and context-aware behaviors by
composing multiple specialized modules into cohesive workflows. Despite growing
adoption in both academia and industry, the CAIS landscape remains fragmented,
lacking a unified framework for analysis, taxonomy, and evaluation. In this
survey, we define the concept of CAIS, propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy
based on component roles and orchestration strategies, and analyze four
foundational paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Agents,
Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and orchestration-centric architectures. We review
representative systems, compare design trade-offs, and summarize evaluation
methodologies across these paradigms. Finally, we identify key
challenges-including scalability, interoperability, benchmarking, and
coordination-and outline promising directions for future research. This survey
aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive foundation
for understanding, developing, and advancing the next generation of

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning where agents use human-defined language for communication, improving learning, coordination, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works on emergent communication in multi-agent systems often result in inefficient or non-interpretable protocols. The study aims to leverage human-defined language to enhance learning and coordination.

Method: Agents are trained to act and produce/interpret natural language descriptions of observations, combining communication and representation learning.

Result: Language-augmented agents outperform traditional emergent communication baselines, showing better generalization and human-agent interaction.

Conclusion: Integrating structured language into multi-agent learning improves interpretability and capability, offering promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Communication is a fundamental aspect of coordinated behavior in multi-agent
reinforcement learning. Yet, most prior works in this field have focused on
emergent communication protocols developed from scratch, often resulting in
inefficient or non-interpretable systems. Inspired by the role of language in
natural intelligence, we investigate how grounding agents in a human-defined
language can improve learning and coordination of multiple embodied agents. We
propose a framework in which agents are trained not only to act but also to
produce and interpret natural language descriptions of their observations. This
language-augmented learning serves a dual role: enabling explicit communication
between agents and guiding representation learning. We demonstrate that agents
trained with our method outperform traditional emergent communication baselines
across various tasks. Our analysis reveals that language grounding leads to
more informative internal representations, better generalization to new
partners, and improved capability for human-agent interaction. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating structured language into
multi-agent learning and open avenues for more interpretable and capable
multi-agent systems.

### [640] [Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05309)
*Niv Eckhaus, Uri Berger, Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: An adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent is developed to decide both what and when to speak, performing comparably to humans in online Mafia games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world settings like group chats or games lack synchronous turns, requiring agents to decide when to speak, unlike current LLM usage.

Method: An asynchronous LLM-agent is created and evaluated using a dataset of online Mafia games with human and agent participants.

Result: The agent matches human performance in game and blending in, with similar timing but differing message content.

Conclusion: This work enables LLM integration into realistic human group settings, advancing asynchronous communication research.

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: IGT-MPC is a decentralized algorithm for multi-agent motion planning using a learned value function to predict game-theoretic outcomes, applied to competitive and cooperative scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address multi-agent motion planning by implicitly accounting for interactions through game-theoretic reasoning and machine learning.

Method: Uses a neural network trained on generalized Nash equilibrium solutions to predict reward outcomes, integrated into an MPC framework as a terminal cost-to-go function.

Result: Demonstrates competitive and cooperative behaviors in scenarios like racing and intersection navigation.

Conclusion: IGT-MPC combines machine learning and game theory for decentralized multi-agent planning, offering a novel approach.

Abstract: We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized
algorithm for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that
predicts the game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go
function in a model predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to
implicitly account for interactions with other agents and maximize their
reward. This approach applies to competitive and cooperative multi-agent motion
planning problems which we formulate as constrained dynamic games. Given a
constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions and solve for
the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE solutions,
computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from the GNE.
The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward
outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We
showcase emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in
scenarios such as two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized
intersection navigation. IGT-MPC offers a novel method integrating machine
learning and game-theoretic reasoning into model-based decentralized
multi-agent motion planning.

experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture,
integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental
design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related
sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher
effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and
logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based
reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics
to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher
successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight
previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols, on average,
outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system
demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and
accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in
automated research systems.

TL;DR: The paper explores how multi-agent discrete-choice combinatorial optimization in Smart Cities is affected by distributed adversary attacks, revealing trajectories from resilience to collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the performance and resilience of multi-agent optimization under adversary attacks is crucial for improving Smart City infrastructures like energy and traffic systems.

Method: The study uses real-world data to simulate over 28 billion multi-agent optimization scenarios, analyzing the impact of adversarial severity and network positioning.

Result: The research identifies conditions under which optimization remains resilient or becomes vulnerable/collapsed, providing insights into Pareto optimal points.

Conclusion: The findings offer new insights for designing self-healing strategies in adversarial distributed optimization, addressing gaps in fault-tolerance and correction.

Abstract: Optimization is instrumental for improving operations of large-scale
socio-technical infrastructures of Smart Cities, for instance, energy and
traffic systems. In particular, understanding the performance of multi-agent
discrete-choice combinatorial optimization under distributed adversary attacks
is a compelling and underexplored problem, since multi-agent systems exhibit a
large number of remote control variables that can influence in an unprecedented
way the cost-effectiveness of distributed optimization heuristics. This paper
unravels for the first time the trajectories of distributed optimization from
resilience to vulnerability, and finally to collapse under varying adversary
influence. Using real-world data to emulate over 28 billion multi-agent
optimization scenarios, we exhaustively assess how the number of agents with
different adversarial severity and network positioning influences optimization
performance, including the influence on Pareto optimal points. With this novel
large-scale dataset, made openly available as a benchmark, we disentangle how
optimization remains resilient to adversaries and which adversary conditions
are required to make optimization vulnerable or collapsed. These new findings
can provide new insights for designing self-healing strategies for
fault-tolerance and fault-correction in adversarial distributed optimization
that have been missing so far.

### [644] [Sonic: Shifting Focus to Global Audio Perception in Portrait Animation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16331)
*Xiaozhong Ji, Xiaobin Hu, Zhihong Xu, Junwei Zhu, Chuming Lin, Qingdong He, Jiangning Zhang, Donghao Luo, Yi Chen, Qin Lin, Qinglin Lu, Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sonic, a novel paradigm for talking face generation that shifts focus to global audio perception, improving naturalness and temporal consistency without relying on visual signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on auxiliary visual and spatial knowledge, leading to unnatural results. Audio signals are ideal for guiding facial expressions and lip movements.

Method: Sonic disentangles global audio perception into intra- and inter-clip aspects, using context-enhanced audio learning, motion-decoupled controllers, and time-aware position shift fusion.

Result: Sonic outperforms state-of-the-art methods in video quality, temporal consistency, lip sync precision, and motion diversity.

Conclusion: Focusing on global audio perception enhances talking face generation, offering a more natural and coherent solution.

Abstract: The study of talking face generation mainly explores the intricacies of
synchronizing facial movements and crafting visually appealing,
temporally-coherent animations. However, due to the limited exploration of
global audio perception, current approaches predominantly employ auxiliary
visual and spatial knowledge to stabilize the movements, which often results in
the deterioration of the naturalness and temporal inconsistencies.Considering
the essence of audio-driven animation, the audio signal serves as the ideal and
unique priors to adjust facial expressions and lip movements, without resorting
to interference of any visual signals. Based on this motivation, we propose a
novel paradigm, dubbed as Sonic, to {s}hift f{o}cus on the exploration of
global audio per{c}ept{i}o{n}.To effectively leverage global audio knowledge,
we disentangle it into intra- and inter-clip audio perception and collaborate
with both aspects to enhance overall perception.For the intra-clip audio
perception, 1). \textbf{Context-enhanced audio learning}, in which long-range
intra-clip temporal audio knowledge is extracted to provide facial expression
and lip motion priors implicitly expressed as the tone and speed of speech. 2).
\textbf{Motion-decoupled controller}, in which the motion of the head and
expression movement are disentangled and independently controlled by
intra-audio clips. Most importantly, for inter-clip audio perception, as a
bridge to connect the intra-clips to achieve the global perception,
\textbf{Time-aware position shift fusion}, in which the global inter-clip audio
information is considered and fused for long-audio inference via through
consecutively time-aware shifted windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the novel audio-driven paradigm outperform existing SOTA methodologies in
terms of video quality, temporally consistency, lip synchronization precision,
and motion diversity.

### [645] [CMIE: Combining MLLM Insights with External Evidence for Explainable Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23449)
*Fanxiao Li, Jiaying Wu, Canyuan He, Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper highlights challenges in MLLMs for detecting out-of-context misinformation and proposes CMIE, a framework with CRG and AS mechanisms, showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing MLLMs' limitations in capturing deeper semantic relationships and noise sensitivity in misinformation detection.

Method: Proposes CMIE framework with Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) and Association Scoring (AS) mechanisms.

Result: CMIE outperforms existing methods in detecting out-of-context misinformation.

Conclusion: CMIE effectively addresses MLLMs' challenges, improving misinformation detection accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies
have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC)
misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of
this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning
and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to
capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and
text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic
links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection
framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG)
strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the
underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively
utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

*Yuxuan Hu, Haibin Wu, Ruchao Fan, Xiaofei Wang, Heng Lu, Yao Qian, Jinyu Li*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Phi-Omni-ST is a multimodal LM for speech-to-speech translation, outperforming baselines and matching SOTA with scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enabling speech-aware LMs to efficiently produce speech output remains a challenge.

Method: Extends Phi-4 MM with an audio transformer head for delayed audio token prediction and a streaming vocoder.

Result: Superior performance on CVSS-C dataset; matches SOTA with scaled training.

Conclusion: Phi-Omni-ST advances speech-to-speech translation, showing promise with scaling.

Abstract: Speech-aware language models (LMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
understanding spoken language while generating text-based responses. However,
enabling them to produce speech output efficiently and effectively remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present Phi-Omni-ST, a multimodal LM for direct
speech-to-speech translation (ST), built on the open-source Phi-4 MM model.
Phi-Omni-ST extends its predecessor by generating translated speech using an
audio transformer head that predicts audio tokens with a delay relative to text
tokens, followed by a streaming vocoder for waveform synthesis. Our
experimental results on the CVSS-C dataset demonstrate Phi-Omni-ST's superior
performance, significantly surpassing existing baseline models trained on the
same dataset. Furthermore, when we scale up the training data and the model
size, Phi-Omni-ST reaches on-par performance with the current SOTA model.

### [647] [Can we reconstruct a dysarthric voice with the large speech model Parler TTS?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04397)
*Ariadna Sanchez, Simon King*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores using Parler TTS, a large speech model, to reconstruct the pre-dysarthric voices of individuals with speech disorders, aiming for intelligibility and speaker identity retention. Results show potential but highlight challenges in controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech disorders hinder communication; personalized Text-to-Speech (TTS) offers a solution. The study aims to reconstruct pre-dysarthric voices using advanced TTS models.

Method: The authors fine-tune Parler TTS on a curated dataset annotated with speaker and intelligibility data to approximate pre-dysarthric voices.

Result: The model learns to generate speech from challenging data but struggles with intelligibility control and consistent speaker identity.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on improving controllability of TTS models for voice reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

### [648] [Bringing Interpretability to Neural Audio Codecs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04492)
*Samir Sadok, Julien Hauret, Éric Bavu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores how neural audio codecs encode speech attributes like content, identity, and pitch, proposing a two-step approach for analysis and synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the encoding of speech information in neural audio codec tokens, which lack interpretability due to their focus on reconstruction performance.

Method: A two-step approach: analysis to study speech attribute encoding, followed by synthesis using an AnCoGen network to extract attributes from tokens.

Result: Insights into how speech attributes are encoded in codec tokens and a method for direct attribute extraction.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances interpretability of neural audio codecs by analyzing and synthesizing speech attributes from tokens.

Abstract: The advent of neural audio codecs has increased in popularity due to their
potential for efficiently modeling audio with transformers. Such advanced
codecs represent audio from a highly continuous waveform to low-sampled
discrete units. In contrast to semantic units, acoustic units may lack
interpretability because their training objectives primarily focus on
reconstruction performance. This paper proposes a two-step approach to explore
the encoding of speech information within the codec tokens. The primary goal of
the analysis stage is to gain deeper insight into how speech attributes such as
content, identity, and pitch are encoded. The synthesis stage then trains an
AnCoGen network for post-hoc explanation of codecs to extract speech attributes
from the respective tokens directly.

### [649] [French Listening Tests for the Assessment of Intelligibility, Quality, and Identity of Body-Conducted Speech Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04495)
*Thomas Joubaud, Julien Hauret, Véronique Zimpfer, Éric Bavu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: EBEN improves speech quality and intelligibility in body-conduction sensors but slightly reduces speaker identification for female throat recordings. STOI correlates with perceived quality, but no metric predicts intelligibility effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate EBEN's performance on body-conduction sensors, focusing on intelligibility, speech quality, and speaker identity preservation.

Method: Used Vibravox dataset with French Modified Rhyme Test (intelligibility), MUSHRA (quality), and A/B identification (speaker identity). Tested on forehead accelerometer, rigid in-ear, and throat microphones.

Result: EBEN enhances speech quality and intelligibility but slightly degrades female throat microphone speaker identification. STOI correlates with perceived quality; ECAPA2-TDNN aligns with identification. No metric predicts intelligibility effects.

Conclusion: EBEN is effective for body-conducted speech enhancement but has limitations in speaker identification for specific cases. STOI and ECAPA2-TDNN are useful metrics, but intelligibility prediction remains challenging.

Abstract: This study evaluates the Extreme Bandwidth Extension Network (EBEN) model on
body-conduction sensors through listening tests. Using the Vibravox dataset, we
assess intelligibility with a French Modified Rhyme Test, speech quality with a
MUSHRA (MUltiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor) protocol and speaker
identity preservation with an A/B identification task. The experiments involved
male and female speakers recorded with a forehead accelerometer, rigid in-ear
and throat microphones. The results confirm that EBEN enhances both speech
quality and intelligibility. It slightly degrades speaker identification
performance when applied to female speakers' throat microphone recordings. The
findings also demonstrate a correlation between Short-Time Objective
Intelligibility (STOI) and perceived quality in body-conducted speech, while
speaker verification using ECAPA2-TDNN aligns well with identification
performance. No tested metric reliably predicts EBEN's effect on
intelligibility.

### [650] [Towards Efficient Speech-Text Jointly Decoding within One Speech Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04518)
*Haibin Wu, Yuxuan Hu, Ruchao Fan, Xiaofei Wang, Kenichi Kumatani, Bo Ren, Jianwei Yu, Heng Lu, Lijuan Wang, Yao Qian, Jinyu Li*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper compares joint speech-text decoding strategies, finding the interleaved approach best for alignment but slow. A novel early-stop interleaved (ESI) method is proposed to speed up decoding and improve performance. High-quality QA datasets are also curated to enhance speech QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve performance, efficiency, and alignment quality in speech-text joint decoding for spoken dialogue systems.

Method: Systematic comparison of interleaved and parallel generation paradigms, followed by proposing the ESI pattern and curating QA datasets.

Result: Interleaved approach achieves best alignment but is slow; ESI accelerates decoding and improves performance. QA datasets enhance speech QA.

Conclusion: The ESI pattern and curated QA datasets offer efficient and effective solutions for speech-text joint decoding.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

*Yi-Cheng Lin, Huang-Cheng Chou, Yu-Hsuan Li Liang, Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: EMO-Debias compares 13 debiasing methods for gender bias in multi-label SER, evaluating fairness-accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender bias in SER systems is underexplored, especially in multi-label scenarios, necessitating a comprehensive debiasing study.

Method: Large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing techniques (pre-processing, regularization, adversarial learning, etc.) on acted and naturalistic datasets using WavLM and XLSR.

Result: Identifies methods that reduce gender performance gaps without compromising accuracy, highlighting dataset distribution impacts.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for selecting debiasing strategies in SER, emphasizing fairness-accuracy balance.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such
multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present
EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to
multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,
regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally
robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion
datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under
conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and
highlight the impact of dataset distributions.

*Fredrik Cumlin, Xinyu Liang, Victor Ungureanu, Chandan K. A. Reddy, Christian Schüldt, Saikat Chatterjee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper extends MOS to a multivariate framework using a Gaussian model, improving speech quality diagnosis by capturing uncertainty and correlations across dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MOS lacks specificity for distortions; the NISQA dataset adds dimensions, but univariate methods miss correlations.

Method: Uses a multivariate Gaussian with Cholesky decomposition for covariance prediction and probabilistic affine transformations.

Result: Matches state-of-the-art in point estimation while providing uncertainty and correlation estimates.

Conclusion: Enables better diagnosis and targeted improvements for speech quality issues.

Abstract: The mean opinion score (MOS) is a standard metric for assessing speech
quality, but its singular focus fails to identify specific distortions when low
scores are observed. The NISQA dataset addresses this limitation by providing
ratings across four additional dimensions: noisiness, coloration,
discontinuity, and loudness, alongside MOS. In this paper, we extend the
explored univariate MOS estimation to a multivariate framework by modeling
these dimensions jointly using a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Our
approach utilizes Cholesky decomposition to predict covariances without
imposing restrictive assumptions and extends probabilistic affine
transformations to a multivariate context. Experimental results show that our
model performs on par with state-of-the-art methods in point estimation, while
uniquely providing uncertainty and correlation estimates across speech quality
dimensions. This enables better diagnosis of poor speech quality and informs
targeted improvements.

### [653] [Evaluation of LLMs in Speech is Often Flawed: Test Set Contamination in Large Language Models for Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22251)
*Yuan Tseng, Titouan Parcollet, Rogier van Dalen, Shucong Zhang, Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: LLM performance on speech tasks may be inflated due to dataset contamination in LibriSpeech and Common Voice, as contaminated LLMs show bias toward seen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the reliability of LLM-based speech systems by examining dataset contamination and its impact on performance.

Method: Compare LLMs trained with and without contamination, analyze their outputs, and evaluate speech recognisers built on these LLMs.

Result: Contaminated LLMs generate test sentences seen during training and assign higher probabilities to such transcriptions, though error rates differ only slightly.

Conclusion: Dataset contamination biases LLM outputs, underscoring the need for held-out data in evaluating LLM-based speech systems.

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can improve
performance of speech tasks compared to existing systems. To support their
claims, results on LibriSpeech and Common Voice are often quoted. However, this
work finds that a substantial amount of the LibriSpeech and Common Voice
evaluation sets appear in public LLM pretraining corpora. This calls into
question the reliability of findings drawn from these two datasets. To measure
contamination impact, LLMs trained with/without contamination are compared. A
contaminated LLM is more likely to generate test sentences it has seen during
training. Then, speech recognisers based on LLMs are compared. They show only
subtle error rate differences if the LLM is contaminated, but assign
significantly higher probabilities to transcriptions seen during LLM training.
Results show that LLM outputs can be biased by tiny amounts of data
contamination, highlighting the importance of evaluating LLM-based speech
systems with held-out data.

### [654] [Inter-Speaker Relative Cues for Text-Guided Target Speech Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01483)
*Wang Dai, Archontis Politis, Tuomas Virtanen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A novel approach using inter-speaker relative cues for target speaker extraction, combining continuous and discrete cues for flexibility and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance target speech extraction by leveraging relative speaker cues, enabling easier dataset expansion and better adaptability.

Method: Utilizes grouped continuous cues (e.g., temporal order, pitch) and discrete cues (e.g., gender, language). Fine-tunes pre-trained WavLM Base+ CNN encoders.

Result: Combining all cues outperforms random subsets, with gender and temporal order being most robust. Additional cues like pitch and loudness aid in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Relative cues offer flexibility and performance gains, with fine-tuned encoders further improving results over baseline methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach that utilizes inter-speaker relative cues for
distinguishing target speakers and extracting their voices from mixtures.
Continuous cues (e.g., temporal order, age, pitch level) are grouped by
relative differences, while discrete cues (e.g., language, gender, emotion)
retain their categories. Relative cues offers greater flexibility than fixed
speech attribute classification, facilitating much easier expansion of
text-guided target speech extraction datasets. Our experiments show that
combining all relative cues yields better performance than random subsets, with
gender and temporal order being the most robust across languages and
reverberant conditions. Additional cues like pitch level, loudness, distance,
speaking duration, language, and pitch range also demonstrate notable benefit
in complex scenarios. Fine-tuning pre-trained WavLM Base+ CNN encoders improves
overall performance over the baseline of using only a Conv1d encoder.

*Hasin Us Sami, Swapneel Sen, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury, Srikanth V. Krishnamurthy, Basak Guler*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores privacy risks in federated learning (FL) with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), showing how gradient inversion attacks can reconstruct user data from adapter gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in FL with PEFT, where users fine-tune lightweight modules while keeping the backbone model frozen.

Method: Investigates gradient inversion attacks on adapter modules, demonstrating how local data can be reconstructed from shared gradients.

Result: Shows that a batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity, revealing privacy vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms in PEFT and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

### [656] [A Poisson-Guided Decomposition Network for Extreme Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04470)
*Isha Rao, Sanjay Ghosh*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A lightweight deep learning method integrates Retinex decomposition and Poisson denoising for low-light image enhancement, improving visibility without color distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional noise assumptions like Gaussian noise fail in low-light conditions where Poisson noise is more accurate, necessitating a specialized denoising and enhancement approach.

Method: A unified encoder-decoder network combines Retinex decomposition with Poisson denoising, using a Poisson denoising loss to handle signal-dependent noise without requiring reflectance/illumination priors.

Result: The method enhances visibility and brightness while preserving image structure and color constancy under low-light conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses Poisson noise in extreme low-light scenarios, offering practical improvements in image quality.

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when
traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority.
In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is
signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we
address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme
low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method
that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a
unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination
and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address
signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and
illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while
ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any
form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination
enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness
in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy
under ambient illumination.

*Usman Muhammad, Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DACN, a dual-attention CNN, improves hyperspectral image super-resolution by combining multi-head and channel attention, addressing local context and band correlation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D CNNs lack global contextual understanding and struggle with band correlation and data scarcity in hyperspectral image super-resolution.

Method: DACN uses augmented convolutions with multi-head attention for local-global feature capture, separate channel-spatial attention maps, and a custom loss function (L2 + spatial-spectral gradient loss).

Result: DACN outperforms single-attention mechanisms on two hyperspectral datasets.

Conclusion: Combining multi-head and channel attention enhances hyperspectral super-resolution performance.

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention
for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is
their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global
contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue
to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a
dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution.
Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating
multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature
dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and
spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and
spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed
that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure
accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention
outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PixCell is a diffusion-based generative model for histopathology, trained on a large dataset to synthesize high-quality images for tasks like data augmentation, privacy-preserving sharing, and virtual staining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in pathology like data scarcity, privacy concerns, and generative tasks such as virtual staining.

Method: Uses a progressive training strategy and self-supervision-based conditioning on PanCan-30M dataset (69,184 H&E-stained slides).

Result: Generates diverse, high-quality synthetic images usable for training discriminative models, data augmentation, and inferring molecular markers.

Conclusion: PixCell is a versatile foundation model for computational pathology, enabling synthetic data use and accelerating research.

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to
use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

*Hangyu Ji*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DM-SegNet introduces a Dual-Mamba architecture for 3D medical image segmentation, combining directional state transitions with hierarchical decoding to address encoder-decoder incompatibility in existing SSMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing State Space Models (SSMs) for medical image segmentation compromise spatial structures due to 1D sequence flattening, and conventional decoders fail to utilize Mamba's state propagation effectively.

Method: DM-SegNet features a quadri-directional spatial Mamba module, gated spatial convolution layer, and Mamba-driven decoding for bidirectional state synchronization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art DSC of 85.44% on Synapse (abdominal organ segmentation) and 90.22% on BraTS2023 (brain tumor segmentation).

Conclusion: DM-SegNet effectively reconciles global context modeling with spatial topology preservation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of
reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While
State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling,
existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the
encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while
conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present
DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions
with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a
quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning
to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer
that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state
modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state
synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically
significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving
state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse
dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset
for brain tumor segmentation.

*Antoine Legouhy, Ross Callaghan, Whitney Stee, Philippe Peigneux, Hojjat Azadbakht, Hui Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning approach is proposed to correct eddy-current distortions in diffusion MRI, offering comparable results to FSL~Eddy with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eddy-current distortions in diffusion MRI disrupt volume alignment, complicating analysis. Current solutions like FSL~Eddy are computationally expensive.

Method: Two convolutional neural networks are used: one to restore image correspondence and another for registration.

Result: The method achieves distortion estimates similar to FSL~Eddy with modest training data.

Conclusion: This DL-based approach, combined with other techniques, enables real-time preprocessing, enhancing clinical adoption of diffusion MRI.

Abstract: Modern diffusion MRI sequences commonly acquire a large number of volumes
with diffusion sensitization gradients of differing strengths or directions.
Such sequences rely on echo-planar imaging (EPI) to achieve reasonable scan
duration. However, EPI is vulnerable to off-resonance effects, leading to
tissue susceptibility and eddy-current induced distortions. The latter is
particularly problematic because it causes misalignment between volumes,
disrupting downstream modelling and analysis. The essential correction of eddy
distortions is typically done post-acquisition, with image registration.
However, this is non-trivial because correspondence between volumes can be
severely disrupted due to volume-specific signal attenuations induced by
varying directions and strengths of the applied gradients. This challenge has
been successfully addressed by the popular FSL~Eddy tool but at considerable
computational cost. We propose an alternative approach, leveraging recent
advances in image processing enabled by deep learning (DL). It consists of two
convolutional neural networks: 1) An image translator to restore correspondence
between images; 2) A registration model to align the translated images. Results
demonstrate comparable distortion estimates to FSL~Eddy, while requiring only
modest training sample sizes. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the
first to tackle this problem with deep learning. Together with recently
developed DL-based susceptibility correction techniques, they pave the way for
real-time preprocessing of diffusion MRI, facilitating its wider uptake in the
clinic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in fetal brain MRI segmentation due to data heterogeneity and scarcity, the study aims to enhance domain generalization.

Method: Uses Gaussian mixture models in FetalSynthSeg, incorporates intensity clustering, and combines synthetic pretraining with fine-tuning and weight-space interpolation.

Result: DRIFTS achieves superior OOD generalization, validated on 308 subjects across diverse datasets and scanner settings.

Conclusion: DRIFTS is effective for fetal brain MRI segmentation, with five practical recommendations for extending SynthSeg-based methods to other organs/modalities.

Abstract: Fetal brain tissue segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a
crucial tool that supports understanding of neurodevelopment, yet it faces
challenges due to the heterogeneity of data coming from different scanners and
settings, as well as data scarcity. Recent approaches based on domain
randomization, like SynthSeg, have shown great potential for single-source
domain generalization by simulating images with randomized contrast and image
resolution from the label maps. In this work, we investigate how to maximize
the out-of-domain (OOD) generalization potential of SynthSegbased methods in
fetal brain MRI. Specifically, we demonstrate that the simple Gaussian mixture
models employed in FetalSynthSeg outperform physics-informed generation methods
in terms of OOD generalization. We further show that incorporating intensity
clustering significantly enhances generalization in settings with limited label
classes by producing more realistic synthetic data. By combining synthetic
pretraining with fine-tuning on real images and applying weight-space
interpolation between the two models, we propose DRIFTS as an effective and
practical solution for single-source domain generalization. DRIFTS consistently
outperforms current state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks and is,
to our knowledge, the first method to achieve accurate brain tissue
segmentation on fetal T1-weighted images. We validate our approach on 308
subjects from four datasets acquired at three different sites, covering a range
of scanner field strengths (0.55T to 3T) and both T1w and T2w modalities. We
conclude with five practical recommendations to guide the development of
SynthSeg-based methods for other organs and imaging modalities.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A framework for placental segmentation in T2*-weighted MRI using multi-echo data, addressing challenges like weak boundaries and motion artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate placental segmentation is crucial but difficult due to inconsistent boundary contrast, lack of ground truth annotations, and motion artifacts in T2*-weighted imaging.

Method: Proposes a contrast-augmented framework with masked autoencoding (MAE), masked pseudo-labeling (MPL), and global-local collaboration, plus a semantic matching loss for consistency.

Result: Outperforms single-echo and naive fusion baselines, generalizing effectively across echo times.

Conclusion: First systematic use of multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI for placental segmentation, demonstrating robust performance.

Abstract: Accurate placental segmentation is essential for quantitative analysis of the
placenta. However, this task is particularly challenging in T2*-weighted
placental imaging due to: (1) weak and inconsistent boundary contrast across
individual echoes; (2) the absence of manual ground truth annotations for all
echo times; and (3) motion artifacts across echoes caused by fetal and maternal
movement. In this work, we propose a contrast-augmented segmentation framework
that leverages complementary information across multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI to
learn robust, contrast-invariant representations. Our method integrates: (i)
masked autoencoding (MAE) for self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled
multi-echo slices; (ii) masked pseudo-labeling (MPL) for unsupervised domain
adaptation across echo times; and (iii) global-local collaboration to align
fine-grained features with global anatomical context. We further introduce a
semantic matching loss to encourage representation consistency across echoes of
the same subject. Experiments on a clinical multi-echo placental MRI dataset
demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively across echo times and
outperforms both single-echo and naive fusion baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first work to systematically exploit multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI for
placental segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective AI system for breast cancer detection in mammography, improving screening workflows and clinical acceptance.

Method: Modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with enhanced attention mechanisms, trained on mammograms from a Thai medical center and validated on three datasets.

Result: AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on test sets; strong lesion localization (LLF/NLF) and high concordance with radiologists (83.5%-84.0% for biopsy-confirmed cases).

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test
set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain
generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For
cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the
respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated
using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion
Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying
suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong
agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization
concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6%
localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists'
acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for
out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of
74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good
clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer
screening workflows in clinical practice.
