We\nevaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:\nfine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While\ntransformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on\ndocument-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops\nnotably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly\nfor rare events and complex attributes.

During training,\nthese approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which\nare merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it\nallows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to\nlow-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this\nproblem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained\nand unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model\n$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak\npredictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the\ntwo weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base\nmodel with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted\nmodel learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of\nBoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction.

Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically\nchallenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long\ninputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs\non the task of multi-document reasoning.

While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary\noptimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft\nconstraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce\nfeasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the\npowerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by\nadding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This\nscheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to\nlow-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel\ntempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and\neliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a\nrepresentative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT\nachieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as\nO(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of\nmagnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The\nmethod applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on\nexisting Ising machines."}

A key challenge in bird species identification is that many\nrecordings either lack target species or contain overlapping vocalizations,\ncomplicating automatic identification. To address these problems, we developed\na multi-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in\nDo\\~nana National Park (SW Spain), a wetland of high conservation concern. We\ndeployed AudioMoth recorders in three main habitats across nine locations and\nmanually annotated 461 minutes of audio, resulting in 3749 labeled segments\nspanning 34 classes. We first applied a Bird Song Detector to isolate bird\nvocalizations using spectrogram-based image processing. Then, species were\nclassified using custom models trained at the local scale. Applying the Bird\nSong Detector before classification improved species identification, as all\nmodels performed better when analyzing only the segments where birds were\ndetected.

First, long-term memory is\nsupported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state\nspace block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally\nlinked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by\ndelta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to\nexponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items\nare introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that\nmemory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated\nrelations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the\ntendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted\nablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language\nmodels: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters."}

Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex\ntask often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose\n{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.\nFirst, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To\naccomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of\nstructured instructions: description and difference. The description\ninstruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the\ndifference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference\nchart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual\nfeatures into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent\ncode translation process.

Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many\nnatural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to\nlearn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the\nunderlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all\npreviously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate\nviewpoints and effectively select the most informative one.

Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion\nreconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower\nreconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods\ndirectly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced\nby inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency\ndetail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a\nFrequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical\nimage diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific\nmid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to\nreconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our\nfrequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image\ndifficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the\nmid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index\nscore between the reconstructed and original images.

To further improve\nthe accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we\npropose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS).

However, due to their semantic\nobscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.\nExisting methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the\nassociations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit\nemotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,\nwe propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based\non bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis\nmodule deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.\nNext, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source\ndomains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole\nand metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the\nmutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification\nmechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments\nshow that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.\nSpecifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for\nhyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on\nthe HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore\nthe effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and\nmetaphor detection."}

Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful\nbalance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused\nimages effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the\nfunctional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited\ncapacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer\nfrom insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused\nimage quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage\ndiffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In\nStage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet\ncaptures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents\nmultilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the\nsubsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input\ninto the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.\nThree key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from\ndifferent modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a\nhybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,\ncolor, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The\nexperimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the\nproposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation\nmetrics.

However, the crucial choice of window size presents a\nPareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but\noffer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller\nwindows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and\nMistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining\nlength) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift\nthis Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains\neven in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic\nlimitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the\ndefined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated\nwith a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information\nfrom these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B\nscales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between\nperformance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of\njust 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across\ndiverse settings.

Circuit cutting\ntechniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on\nsmaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However,\nthis partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the\nexpectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to\nestimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel\nregularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the\noverhead associated with sampling.

Federated Self-Supervised Learning\n(FSSL) utilizes Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for local training in FL,\neliminating the need for labels while protecting privacy. Compared to other SSL\nmethods, Momentum Contrast (MoCo) reduces the demand for computing resources\nand storage space by creating a dictionary. However, using MoCo in FSSL\nrequires uploading the local dictionary from vehicles to Base Station (BS),\nwhich poses a risk of privacy leakage. Simplified Contrast (SimCo) addresses\nthe privacy leakage issue in MoCo-based FSSL by using dual temperature instead\nof a dictionary to control sample distribution. Additionally, considering the\nnegative impact of motion blur on model aggregation, and based on SimCo, we\npropose a motion blur-resistant FSSL method, referred to as BFSSL.

We also find that smaller values\nof $\\beta_2$ exacerbate ESP but can act as a form of regularization. While ESP\nis not necessarily indicative of overfitting, higher model capacity can amplify\nthe phenomenon. To further support our analysis, we replicate ESP through a\nhigh-dimensional quadratic minimization task.

To address this challenge, we introduce the use of Reconfigurable\nIntelligent Surfaces (RIS), which provide alternative communication pathways to\nassist vehicular communication. By dynamically adjusting the phase-shift of the\nRIS, the performance of VEC systems can be substantially improved. In this\nwork, we consider a RIS-assisted VEC system, and design an optimal scheme for\nlocal execution power, offloading power, and RIS phase-shift, where random task\narrivals and channel variations are taken into account.

We study sparse transformers not through a lens of efficiency but\nrather in terms of learnability and generalization. Empirically studying a\nrange of attention mechanisms, we find that input-dependent sparse attention\nmodels appear to converge faster and generalize better than standard attention\nmodels, while input-agnostic sparse attention models show no such benefits -- a\nphenomenon that is robust across architectural and optimization hyperparameter\nchoices. This can be interpreted as demonstrating that concentrating a model's\n\"semantic focus\" with respect to the tokens currently being considered (in the\nform of input-dependent sparse attention) accelerates learning. We develop a\ntheoretical characterization of the conditions that explain this behavior. We\nestablish a connection between the stability of the standard softmax and the\nloss function's Lipschitz properties, then show how sparsity affects the\nstability of the softmax and the subsequent convergence and generalization\nguarantees resulting from the attention mechanism.

This leads to a critical\ndilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering\ncompetitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT\nutility while ensuring IP protection?\n  For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA\n3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder)\nsupplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple\ntape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity\n(AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated\ncodes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming\nthe threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE).\nThis offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and\ndegrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies\nthat are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for\nenabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven\nVerilog coding."}

Though many popular methods seek straight line (i.e., zero\nacceleration) trajectories, we show here that a specific class of ``curved''\ntrajectories can significantly improve approximation and learning.
