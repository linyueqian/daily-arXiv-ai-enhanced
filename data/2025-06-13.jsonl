Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face\ninherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language\nitself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by\nsemantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that\nmeaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.\nTo test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM\nagents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs\nunder varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we\nfound average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several\nruns yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical\nboundary ($|S|\\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under\nambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from\nhuman cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical\nfrequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily\nlossy.

However, the inherent long-tailed,\nuncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real\ncausal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by\ndata bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an\nAttentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident\nvideo clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal\nclips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on\naccident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content\nof frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using\ndatasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.\nAdditionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant\ntriple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated\npair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips.

These methods assume that a model trained on normal\ndata cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this\nassumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or\naccurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In\nthis work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for\nanomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly\nsupervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images\ninto the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.\nTo generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly\nrandomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary\ndataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and\nanatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,\nusing both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS\ndataset.

We\nconceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to\nproficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual\nqueries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural\ndesign choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style\naudio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by\nhypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM\noperational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio\nintegration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that\nenhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant\ninformation; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations\nexclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring\npropagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently\nintegrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary\nrepresentations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider\nspectrum of audio information.

In this work, we address\nthese challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We\ninterpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to\nuse a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.\nThis novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both\nthe model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also\nincorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.\nTo perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data\nmodalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a\nnovel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt\noptimization techniques with standard MCMC methods.

To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability\nof the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping\nthe image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image\ninto blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various\ntransformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input\ndiversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting\nintermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the\namplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial\nexamples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the\nauxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the\ntrue class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by\nthe proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on\ntwo public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack\nperformance even under defense strategies."}

However, existing methods encounter\nchallenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability\nto follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To\naddress this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local\ngeometry-controllable CAD generation method.

A key question is how to find directions that\ncapture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely\non dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over\nresidual stream activations to learn directions from scratch.

We begin by describing a broad class of such models --\nstate space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the\nclassic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation\noperator.

EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search\nto sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract\nexecution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and\nfinally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By\nmaintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and\nrefreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance\nwhile preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports\nnative parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in\nparallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad\nset of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks\ndemonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance\ncompared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across\nvarious levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging\ncompetitive programming tasks.

We evaluate Obliviate on four popular 6-8B-parameter models\n(LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.1-Instruct, Qwen-2.5, and Yi-1.5) using synthetic\nmemorization benchmarks and organic copyrighted excerpts (e.g., Moby Dick,\nFrankenstein, Alice in Wonderland and Les Miserables). Across all settings,\nObliviate reduces verbatim recall by two orders of magnitude (e.g., from\nhundreds of words to fewer than 12) while degrading downstream accuracy by at\nmost 1% on HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, and Winogrande.

This problem stems from the fact that theory of mind\nbenchmarks for LLMs are overwhelmingly inspired by the methods used to test\ntheory of mind in humans and fall victim to a fallacy of attributing human-like\nqualities to AI agents. We expect that humans will engage in a consistent\nreasoning process across various questions about a situation, but this is known\nto not be the case for current LLMs. Most theory of mind benchmarks only\nmeasure what we call literal theory of mind: the ability to predict the\nbehavior of others. However, this type of metric is only informative when\nagents exhibit self-consistent reasoning. Thus, we introduce the concept of\nfunctional theory of mind: the ability to adapt to agents in-context following\na rational response to their behavior. We find that many open source LLMs are\ncapable of displaying strong literal theory of mind capabilities, but seem to\nstruggle with functional theory of mind -- even with exceedingly simple partner\npolicies.

We provide\nrigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural\nTangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,\nuniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights\ndemonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to\nquantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational\nadvantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum\narchitectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through\nextensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge\nstates and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating\nresilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This\nresearch establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,\nadvancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional\ncomputing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond."}

Methods for picking from clutter\nmust work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency\nconstraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes\nmultiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to\nestimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained\nfrom real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain\nand finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation\nperformed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted\nto include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on\ncontainers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The\nevaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,\nand object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain\npretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of\nfinetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over\nmultiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining\nthe relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,\nonly a subset of them can be used as input."}

This inspires researchers in transferring the knowledge from\nthese large pre-trained models to other task-specific models, e.g., Video\nAction Recognition (VAR) models, via particularly leveraging side networks to\nenhance the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However,\ncurrent transferring approaches in VAR tend to directly transfer the frozen\nknowledge from large pre-trained models to action recognition networks with\nminimal cost, instead of exploiting the temporal modeling capabilities of the\naction recognition models themselves. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel memory-efficient Temporal Difference Side Network (TDS-CLIP) to balance\nknowledge transferring and temporal modeling, avoiding backpropagation in\nfrozen parameter models. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Difference\nAdapter (TD-Adapter), which can effectively capture local temporal differences\nin motion features to strengthen the model's global temporal modeling\ncapabilities. Furthermore, we designed a Side Motion Enhancement Adapter\n(SME-Adapter) to guide the proposed side network in efficiently learning the\nrich motion information in videos, thereby improving the side network's ability\nto capture and learn motion information.

In this paper, we define five key\nproperties for a successful fingerprint: Transparency, Efficiency, Persistence,\nRobustness, and Unforgeability. We introduce a novel fingerprinting framework\nthat provides verifiable proof of ownership while maintaining fingerprint\nintegrity. Our approach makes two main contributions. First, we propose a Chain\nand Hash technique that cryptographically binds fingerprint prompts with their\nresponses, ensuring no adversary can generate colliding fingerprints and\nallowing model owners to irrefutably demonstrate their creation. Second, we\naddress a realistic threat model in which instruction-tuned models' output\ndistribution can be significantly altered through meta-prompts. By integrating\nrandom padding and varied meta-prompt configurations during training, our\nmethod preserves fingerprint robustness even when the model's output style is\nsignificantly modified.

For example, LLMs tend to\ndetermine causal relationships based on the topological ordering of events\n(i.e., earlier events cause later ones), resulting in lower performance\nwhenever events are not narrated in their exact causal order. Similarly, we\ndemonstrate that LLMs struggle with long-term causal reasoning and often fail\nwhen the narratives are long and contain many events.

A central theme here is the\nadaptive discretization of the action space, which gradually ``zooms in'' on\nthe more promising regions thereof. The goal is to take advantage of ``nicer''\nproblem instances, while retaining near-optimal worst-case performance. While\nthe stochastic version of the problem is well-understood, the general version\nwith adversarial rewards is not.\n  We provide the first algorithm (\\emph{Adversarial Zooming}) for adaptive\ndiscretization in the adversarial version, and derive instance-dependent regret\nbounds. In particular, we recover the worst-case optimal regret bound for the\nadversarial version, and the instance-dependent regret bound for the stochastic\nversion.\n  We apply our algorithm to several fundamental applications -- including\ndynamic pricing and auction reserve tuning -- all under adversarial reward\nmodels. While these domains often violate Lipschitzness, our analysis only\nrequires a weaker version thereof, allowing for meaningful regret bounds\nwithout additional smoothness assumptions. Notably, we extend our results to\nmulti-product dynamic pricing with non-smooth reward structures, a setting\nwhich does not even satisfy one-sided Lipschitzness."}

Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling\nmechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject\ncharacteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across\ngenerated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based\non both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and\nconsistent visual stories.

Most of the literature mostly\nstudies generalization from an interpolation point of view, taking convergence\nof parameters towards a global minimum of the training loss for granted. While\noverparametrized architectures indeed interpolated the data for typical\nclassification tasks, this interpolation paradigm does not seem valid anymore\nfor more complex tasks such as in-context learning or diffusion. Instead for\nsuch tasks, it has been empirically observed that the trained models goes from\nglobal minima to spurious local minima of the training loss as the number of\ntraining samples becomes larger than some level we call optimization threshold.\nWhile the former yields a poor generalization to the true population loss, the\nlatter was observed to actually correspond to the minimiser of this true loss.\nThis paper explores theoretically this phenomenon in the context of two-layer\nReLU networks. We demonstrate that, despite overparametrization, networks often\nconverge toward simpler solutions rather than interpolating the training data,\nwhich can lead to a drastic improvement on the test loss with respect to\ninterpolating solutions. Our analysis relies on the so called early alignment\nphase, during which neurons align towards specific directions. This directional\nalignment, which occurs in the early stage of training, leads to a simplicity\nbias, wherein the network approximates the ground truth model without\nconverging to the global minimum of the training loss. Our results suggest that\nthis bias, resulting in an optimization threshold from which interpolation is\nnot reached anymore, is beneficial and enhances the generalization of trained\nmodels."}

To address this, we introduce\nDistributionally Robust Optimisation with Bayesian Ambiguity Sets (DRO-BAS)\nwhich hedges against model uncertainty by optimising the worst-case risk over a\nposterior-informed ambiguity set. We provide two such sets, based on posterior\nexpectations (DRO-BAS(PE)) or posterior predictives (DRO-BAS(PP)) and prove\nthat both admit, under conditions, strong dual formulations leading to\nefficient single-stage stochastic programs which are solved with a sample\naverage approximation.

This\nproblem arises in various practical domains where avoiding congested demand is\ncrucial, such as online retail sales and compute services, as well as in\nadvertising campaigns that require sustained visibility over time. We introduce\na simple model of this phenomenon, modeling it as a budgeted auction where the\nvalue of a win is a concave function of the time since the last win. This\nimplies that for a given number of wins, even spacing over time is optimal. We\nalso extend our model and results to the case when not all wins result in\n\"conversions\" (realization of actual gains), and the probability of conversion\ndepends on a context. The goal is to maximize and evenly space conversions\nrather than just wins.\n  We study the optimal policies for this setting in second-price auctions and\noffer learning algorithms for the bidders that achieve low regret against the\noptimal bidding policy in a Bayesian online setting. Our main result is a\ncomputationally efficient online learning algorithm that achieves $\\tilde\nO(\\sqrt T)$ regret. We achieve this by showing that an infinite-horizon Markov\ndecision process (MDP) with the budget constraint in expectation is essentially\nequivalent to our problem, even when limiting that MDP to a very small number\nof states. The algorithm achieves low regret by learning a bidding policy that\nchooses bids as a function of the context and the system's state, which will be\nthe time elapsed since the last win (or conversion). We show that\nstate-independent strategies incur linear regret even without uncertainty of\nconversions. We complement this by showing that there are state-independent\nstrategies that, while still having linear regret, achieve a $(1-\\frac 1 e)$\napproximation to the optimal reward."}
